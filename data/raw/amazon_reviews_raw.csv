B09TVVGXWS,4.1,"I have been a user of OnePlus Bullets wireless earphones for almost 4-5 years now. The very first one I purchased was Bullets Z, then Bullets Z bass edition and Z2 twice. So, a total of 4 bullet series I have purchased as of now.
Regarding the life, it is really quite durable. The very first one I purchased still works really fine. The only thing is you will have to make sure it doesn't break. Until then, it will work really, really good.
Sound, look and everything is good for the price. If you want not very bass boosted sound like boat, this could be the perfect choice for you.

It supports fast charging and has good enough battery life.
Not the most you can expect in the market, but it has a good balance of all the things one might look for when buying a neckband.

Al last, it's the best for calls. Earbuds mics sucks when using it for calls. This will work great even when you will speak very quietly.

It doesn't have noise cancellation in the mics, so it will capture little background noise.
I hope this will help you.

I have attached my first 4.5-year-old neckband pic also, and I am still using it.","There is nothing wrong with the looks of the Bullets Z2, they are actually quite decent looking. They are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. The middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, U shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. The wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. One of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the USB Type C port on the side. You get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. The battery unit has the OnePlus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.

The earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. When the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. The Bullets Wireless Z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. The material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. It also comes with an IP55 rating.
Pairing the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. All you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. You can then look up the buds in the list of Bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. Once connected, the Bullets Z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.

You get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. Now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, OnePlus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. Apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), OnePlus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. You have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. It may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of OnePlus earphones- 12.4mm. The fact that OnePlus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. The earbuds support two audio codecs, SBC and AAC.

As for the audio performance, the Bullets Wireless Z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand’s audio formula in the budget segment. While this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.
If you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the Bullets Wireless Z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.

That said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. We could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. As the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.

They come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. But because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.
The Bullets Wireless Z2 also face some heat from the likes of Oppo Enco M32 and the Realme Buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are actually a great proposition for the price; you only need to have a liking for bass.","If you're on the lookout for a solid pair of wireless earphones, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 might just catch your eye. I've been using them for a while, and here's my honest take on what they have to offer.

Connectivity & Ease of Use:

Let’s start with one of the essentials—connectivity. The OnePlus Bullets Z2 nails it with seamless Bluetooth connectivity that just works. Pairing them with my phone was as simple as it gets, and once connected, they stay that way without any annoying drops. The button placement on the neckband is intuitive, and after a day or two of use, I could easily control playback without needing to glance down, thanks to muscle memory. It’s the kind of convenience you don’t realize you need until you have it.

Sound Quality - Balanced Yet Personal:

Now, onto the sound quality. As someone who values a balanced sound signature, I found the Z2 to be a great match for my taste. Whether I'm listening to some mellow jazz, electronic beats, or even rock, the sound remains well-rounded and crisp. The highs, mids, and lows don't overpower each other, making it perfect for those who don't want their ears blasted with bass or overwhelmed by treble.

That said, sound quality is a subjective experience, and preferences can vary widely. If you're a bass head looking for those earth-shaking lows, you might find these a tad restrained. But if, like me, you appreciate a balanced output across genres, these will hit the right notes for you.

Battery Life & Quick Charging - A Week of Peace:

Battery life is another highlight. With moderate use—think about 1-2 hours daily—you can stretch a single charge to last an entire week. Even if you’re a heavy listener, using them for 6-8 hours straight, they can hold up for around 2-3 days before needing a recharge. And the quick charge feature is a lifesaver—just 10 minutes of charging gets you 2-4 hours of extra playtime, which is perfect for those “oops, I forgot to charge them” moments.

Gaming & Low Latency - Smooth Experience:

I spend a fair bit of time playing games like BGMI, and the low latency mode on the Bullets Z2 makes a noticeable difference. There's minimal lag between the visuals and the audio, which makes for a much more immersive gaming experience. It's not just about the sound being clear; it's also about it being on time, and these earphones deliver that pretty well.

Comfort & Passive Noise Isolation:

Comfort is key when it comes to neckbands, and the Z2 doesn’t disappoint. They come with multiple earbud sizes, so you can pick the one that fits snugly for you. While there’s no active noise cancellation (ANC) here, you can achieve a decent level of passive noise isolation by choosing the right ear tips. This makes a noticeable difference in cutting out background noise during commutes or at the office.

App Experience & Annoying Blinking Light:

Now, onto a couple of quirks. The Bullets Z2 uses the HeyMelody app, which offers additional features like custom sound settings. However, my unit just wouldn’t connect with the app, which was a bummer. So, any fancy tweaks you could make through the app were out of my reach, and I had to rely solely on the default Bluetooth pairing. While everything worked smoothly once connected, I feel like I missed out on some customization options that might have enhanced my experience.

Another thing that bugged me was the small white light that blinks when the neckband is connected to a device. It might not seem like a big deal, but if you’re using the earphones in a dark room or while lying down, that blinking light can be pretty distracting. Plus, it probably drains the battery a bit, albeit a small amount. A simple option to turn this off in the app would’ve been a nice touch.

Final Thoughts - A Solid Pick for Most, with Room for Improvement:

Overall, the OnePlus Z2 delivers where it matters—good sound quality, reliable connectivity, and battery life that won’t have you constantly reaching for the charger. It’s not perfect, especially with the blinking light and app connectivity issues, but those are minor compared to the solid performance it offers. Plus, with the quick-charge feature and low-latency gaming experience, it’s hard not to appreciate the value you get.

If you’re looking for a reliable neckband that blends style, comfort, and balanced audio, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 is definitely worth considering. It might not satisfy those who crave earth-shattering bass, but for most listeners, it's a worthy contender at its price point.","Bought it over a year ago and still works great. The highs and lows are great for a headphone of this cost. Podcast and audible, TEDX listening is also great. Conferencing over PCs is also a breeze. I have 8 headphones with blue tooth but this gives no interference and works stable. GREAT blue tooth range, has problems when you are in 2nd floor and your device is in 1st or ground floor.

This product get so many checkboxes right, while it is not the BEST audio headphone for songs or movies but the ANC feature gets you immersive sound, this also helps a lot when attending calls. There is a slight discomfort for fitting into the ears but with adjusting it this would be fine, This is not a headphone that you can sleep with.
Charging is a little bit slow but that 5-10 mins extra should not be a problem. It easily charges up for almost 80% in 20 mins and comes for 2-2.5 days for a person like who uses it for 6 hours straight everyday. This is not the type of earphone for bikers or during biking though the sound is great but this gets super uncomfortable with helmet on.
These earbuds are highly functional. Though earphones like bose give better sound quality but die on you faster either losing charge or break due to higher maintenance.
This is also a great headphones for gym but it depends how you fix it into your ear as it may fallout of place often. It somehow is greatly sweat resistant and can be used in tougher scenarios.
The loudness is apt. There are 2 or atleast one firmware updates you will get.and once you are version 11.3 you are good to go.
It does not work with some tablets especially with xiaomi pad 6, it could also be a failure from the tablets side. Works well with laptops: tested on windows, mac and ubuntu, fedora linux systems. Also tested with HP ASUS MSI, did not test with lenovo and dell.
The only better buds I found that are as functional as these is the realme wireless buds 3 as it seems to connect with every device. There is usually no reason to avoid this if you enjoy listening to metal or operatic music or jazz or soul or RnB and great for hindustani and carnatic music. Above average for gaming sounds, please avoid if you are chatting over a online game like dota, valorant, fortnite. But for me it worked great on league of legends, acceptable in cs:go, battlefield and I noticed that it works better for PC games rather than extended mobile games. Otherwise it is a great functional headphone. With magnetic shut off you have to careful that if you remove it out for anything it would disconnect.

In my case it works well as a all rounder except for some tabs, I had no problem wih iPad, one plus and realme tabs --- DOES NOT WORK ON XIAOMI TAB 6 BUT FINE WITH REDMI TAB, DID NOT TEST FOR LENOVO AND SAMSUNG.
If you want a pure TWS use the one plus buds 2r, but the sound quality of this headphone is a notch better though.

Please only avoid these earphones if you have a short neck or heavily fat from double chinas the wires cause interference and fall off often even if the grip is good.","I recently purchased the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC Bluetooth in-ear earphones, and I'm really impressed with their performance. The 45dB Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation works wonders in blocking out external noise, which makes the listening experience immersive, whether I'm traveling or just relaxing at home.

The sound quality is top-notch with the 12.4 mm drivers providing rich, clear, and booming bass. It's perfect for all kinds of music genres, from bass-heavy tracks to vocals and instrumental tunes.

What I really appreciate is the fast charging feature – just 10 minutes of charging gives me 20 hours of music playback, which is incredible for daily use. The battery life of up to 28 hours is also impressive, making it perfect for long trips or workdays.

The design is sleek and comfortable, fitting snugly in the ears without feeling heavy or uncomfortable, even after hours of use. The mic works well for calls, and the Bluetooth connectivity is stable with minimal interruptions.

Overall, the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC earphones offer great value for the price. If you're looking for a pair of earphones with amazing sound quality, comfort, and solid battery life, I highly recommend them!","The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is the latest addition to OnePlus' lineup of wireless earphones, offering significant upgrades over its predecessors. These in-ear Bluetooth earphones feature Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) up to 45dB, bombastic bass driven by 12.4mm drivers, and a long-lasting battery life, all packed into an ergonomic design. With just 10 minutes of charging, you get up to 20 hours of music playback, making it an excellent choice for those who need a reliable and powerful audio device on the go. The product is available in the striking ""Grand Green"" color, adding a touch of style to its functional design.

### Design and Build Quality

The design of the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC reflects a balance between aesthetics and practicality. The ""Grand Green"" color gives it a unique, vibrant look that stands out without being overly flashy. The earphones are constructed from high-quality materials, ensuring durability while maintaining a lightweight profile.

**Neckband Design:**
The neckband design is both flexible and sturdy, making it comfortable for long-term wear. The earphones are designed to fit snugly in the ears, which is crucial for effective noise cancellation and bass response. The magnetic earbuds are a convenient feature, allowing the earphones to snap together when not in use, which prevents tangling and conserves battery by automatically pausing playback.

**Ergonomics:**
Ergonomics play a key role in the overall user experience of these earphones. The earbuds are designed to fit comfortably in the ear canal, providing a secure fit that helps to block out external noise even when the ANC is turned off. The lightweight neckband rests comfortably on the shoulders without causing discomfort, making these earphones suitable for extended use.

**Build Quality:**
The build quality of the Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is commendable. The materials used feel premium, and the buttons on the neckband are tactile and responsive. The device is also IP55-rated, meaning it is resistant to dust and water splashes, making it suitable for workouts and outdoor use.

### Sound Quality

One of the standout features of the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is its sound quality, particularly the bass. The 12.4mm dynamic drivers are larger than what is typically found in wireless earphones, and this translates to a rich, deep bass response that is ideal for bass-heavy genres like EDM, hip-hop, and pop.

**Bass Response:**
The bass on these earphones is described as ""bombastic,"" and rightly so. The 12.4mm drivers deliver a powerful low-end that doesn’t overshadow the mids and highs but rather complements them. The bass is punchy and clear, providing a satisfying thump that many users will appreciate, especially during workouts or while commuting.

**Mid and High Frequencies:**
The midrange is well-represented, with vocals and instruments coming through clearly without being drowned out by the bass. The highs are crisp and detailed, offering a balanced sound signature that is versatile enough for various music genres. However, some audiophiles might find the emphasis on bass slightly overpowering for more acoustic or classical tracks.

**Active Noise Cancellation:**
The Hybrid ANC technology in the Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is capable of reducing ambient noise by up to 45dB. This feature works exceptionally well in environments with consistent background noise, such as on public transport or in a busy office. The ANC feature not only enhances the listening experience by minimizing distractions but also allows for lower volume levels, which can help in reducing ear fatigue over time.

### Battery Life

Battery life is another area where the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC excels. The earphones offer up to 28 hours of total battery life on a full charge, which is more than sufficient for daily use. This endurance makes them ideal for long commutes, travel, or extended use throughout the day.

**Fast Charging:**
One of the most impressive aspects of these earphones is their fast charging capability. With just 10 minutes of charging, you can get up to 20 hours of playback time. This feature is particularly useful for those who are often on the move and need a quick top-up before heading out. The full charge time is also relatively short, allowing the earphones to be fully charged in less than an hour.

**Usage with ANC:**
When using ANC, the battery life is understandably reduced, but it still remains impressive. With ANC turned on, you can expect around 18 to 20 hours of playback, which is still above average compared to other wireless earphones in the market. The battery life makes these earphones highly reliable, reducing the need for frequent recharges.

### Connectivity and Controls

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC offers seamless connectivity with Bluetooth 5.0, ensuring a stable connection with minimal latency. The earphones are easy to pair with both Android and iOS devices, although they work particularly well with OnePlus smartphones, which can unlock additional features like quick pairing and battery status notifications.

**Latency:**
For those who enjoy gaming or watching videos on their mobile devices, low latency is a crucial factor. The Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC performs well in this regard, with minimal lag that ensures audio syncs well with video content. This makes them suitable not just for music but also for multimedia consumption.

**Controls:**
The inline controls on the neckband are intuitive and easy to use. The buttons allow for controlling playback, adjusting volume, taking calls, and activating voice assistants. The buttons are well-placed and provide good feedback, making it easy to use the controls without needing to look at them. The earphones also support quick switching between two paired devices, a handy feature for those who frequently switch between their phone and laptop.

**Call Quality:**
The Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC features a built-in microphone that provides clear voice transmission during calls. The noise cancellation technology also extends to call quality, effectively reducing background noise so that your voice comes through clearly even in noisy environments. This makes the earphones suitable for professional use, such as conference calls or virtual meetings.

### Additional Features

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC comes with several additional features that enhance the overall user experience:

**Environmental Noise Cancellation (ENC):**
While ANC helps block out external noise during music playback, the Environmental Noise Cancellation (ENC) technology focuses on improving call quality by reducing background noise during calls. This ensures that your voice is heard clearly on the other end, even in noisy environments.

**Magnetic Control:**
The magnetic control feature automatically pauses music playback when the earbuds are snapped together and resumes when they are separated. This not only helps conserve battery life but also adds convenience, especially when you need to quickly pause and resume your music.

**Voice Assistant Support:**
The earphones support voice assistants like Google Assistant and Siri, allowing for hands-free control of your device. This is particularly useful when you need to make a call, send a message, or get directions without reaching for your phone.

### Comfort and Fit

Comfort is a crucial aspect of any in-ear earphones, and the Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC scores well in this department. The earphones come with multiple sizes of silicone ear tips, ensuring a secure and comfortable fit for different ear shapes. The snug fit also helps with passive noise isolation, further enhancing the effectiveness of the ANC feature.

**Weight and Wearability:**
The earphones are lightweight, making them comfortable to wear for extended periods without causing ear fatigue. The neckband design distributes the weight evenly across the shoulders, preventing the earphones from feeling heavy or cumbersome.

**Suitability for Sports and Workouts:**
Thanks to the IP55 rating, the Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is resistant to sweat and water, making them suitable for workouts and outdoor activities. The secure fit ensures that the earphones stay in place during physical activity, providing a reliable audio experience even during intense exercise.

### Price and Value for Money

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is priced competitively, offering excellent value for money given its feature set. It is positioned in the mid-range segment, making it accessible to a wide range of users while still providing premium features such as Hybrid ANC, powerful bass, and long battery life.

**Comparison with Competitors:**
When compared to other wireless earphones in the same price range, the Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC holds its own, if not outperforms, many competitors. The combination of sound quality, build, and features like fast charging and ANC make it a strong contender in the market. Competitors like the Realme Buds Wireless and JBL Tune series offer similar features, but the overall package of the Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is more refined, especially in terms of bass performance and battery life.

**Long-Term Value:**
Considering the durability, battery life, and sound quality, the Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC represents a long-term investment. The earphones are built to last, and the feature set ensures that they will continue to meet your needs even as your usage patterns evolve.

### Conclusion

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is a well-rounded pair of wireless earphones that excels in multiple areas. Whether you're looking for powerful bass, effective noise cancellation, long battery life, or a comfortable fit, these earphones deliver on all fronts. They are particularly well-suited for users who enjoy bass-heavy music genres and need a reliable pair of earphones for daily use.

**Pros:**
- **Hybrid ANC up to 45dB:** Provides effective noise cancellation for an immersive listening experience.
- **Powerful 12.4mm Drivers:** Delivers deep, punchy bass without compromising on mids and highs.
- **Long Battery Life:** Up to 28 hours of playback on a full charge, with fast charging that provides 20 hours of music in just 10 minutes.
- **Comfortable and Secure Fit:** Ergonomically designed for extended use, with IP55 rating","I recently purchased your headphone, but I am not satisfied with its performance. The sound clarity is not good while riding a bike, and at times, the sound cuts off automatically. These issues are affecting the overall experience, and I am quite disappointed with the product.

I request you to kindly look into the matter and provide a solution or replacement if possible.

Looking forward to your prompt response.","Good sound quality and durable built. However, the wire connecting earbuds quality is degraded over time - little thinner and less flexible compared to earlier sent same models. May be cost compromised.","The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC deliver solid sound with deep bass and surprisingly good noise cancellation for the price. Very comfortable to wear, and the battery life is amazing — easily lasts over 20 hours with ANC on, and fast charging is a lifesaver.

✅ Pros:

Powerful bass

Good ANC

Long battery life

Fast charging

Comfortable & durable

❌ Cons:

No multipoint pairing

Definitely recommended if you're on a budget and want solid ANC!","Really nice for the price. Sounds great, the ANC is better than expected and quite comfortable. My only negative may actually be your positive so take it as u want.. there is no off button. The ear pieces stick together with magnets automatically disconnecting the device.

**Purchased on:** 29th September 2024

**Pros:**

1. **Impressive Bluetooth Range:** Thanks to Bluetooth 5.3, I experience clear audio with minimal distortion on both my phone and laptop, even when I'm in another room.
2. **Enhanced Audio Quality with AAC Codec:** The inclusion of the AAC codec noticeably improves audio clarity.
3. **Effective Active Noise Cancellation (ANC):** This feature performs exceptionally well, effectively reducing background noise even in crowded spaces like carnivals or the gym.
4. **Clear Microphone Quality:** The mic quality is excellent; I’m consistently heard loud and clear on calls.
5. **Useful Transparency Mode:** Allows you to remain aware of your surroundings—great for safety when biking.
6. **Quick Charge Feature:** Battery reaches full charge in just 15-20 minutes, making it super convenient.
7. **Seamless Device Switching:** The function button quickly swaps between last-paired devices and reconnects automatically.
8. **Google Fast Pair Support:** For easy pairing with compatible devices.
9. **Sturdy Build:** The neckband and cables feel durable, though I'd recommend handling with care.
10. **Secure Fit:** Stays put in the ears without slipping out.

**Cons:**

1. **Frequent Disconnection on Windows:** There's a consistent disconnecting issue when paired with a Windows laptop, which doesn’t happen on other devices. This may not be a concern if it’s used exclusively on the laptop.
2. **Volume Limitation:** Despite the 12.4mm drivers, the sound feels slightly low, requiring a 50%+ volume level.
3. **Occasional Call Connection Issues:** Sometimes, the phone defaults to its own earpiece instead of the neckband during calls.
4. **Battery Life Falls Short:** With ANC, I get about 6-7 hours of playback, and around 15 hours with ANC off, which doesn’t meet the 20-hour claim by OnePlus.
5. **Comfort Issues at First:** The earbuds felt a bit uncomfortable during initial use, but this improved slightly after a month. However, if my ears are moist, they still can feel a bit stingy.
6. **Bass Might Disappoint Bass Lovers:** Bass isn’t as pronounced, though mids and trebles are well-balanced.
7. **No Dual Device Pairing:** Limits multitasking with multiple devices.

While the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is a decent buy under ₹1,800, I wouldn't recommend it at a higher price point. There are other options worth considering if you’re willing to explore!","I recently got my hands on the OnePlus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless Earphones, and I have to say, they’ve made a significant impression on me. Here’s my take on the pros and cons based on my experience.

Pros:
Bombastic Bass: The 12.4 mm drivers deliver incredible bass that really enhances my listening experience. Whether I'm jamming to music or watching movies, the sound quality is truly impressive.

Comfortable Fit: These earphones come with different ear tip sizes, allowing me to find the perfect fit. They sit snugly in my ears, making them comfortable for extended use.

Good Battery Life: I appreciate the battery performance; they last for hours on a single charge, so I can enjoy my music throughout the day without constantly worrying about recharging.

Clear Microphone Quality: The built-in microphone does a great job during calls. I’ve received positive feedback from friends and family about how clear I sound, even in noisy environments.

Fast Charging: The fast charging feature is a lifesaver. A quick charge provides several hours of playback, which is perfect when I’m in a rush.

Cons:
Limited Controls: The controls are somewhat basic. While they allow for play/pause and volume adjustments, I wish they had more options for customizing sound settings directly.

No Active Noise Cancellation: Although the sound quality is great, the absence of active noise cancellation means that background noise can be noticeable, which can be distracting in loud settings.

Wired Design: As a neckband style, the cable can sometimes get in the way during activities, like exercising. I prefer fully wireless options for a more seamless experience.

Build Quality: While they feel decent, I did notice that the build quality could be a bit sturdier. I’m a bit concerned about how they’ll hold up over time with regular use.

Conclusion
Overall, I’m quite satisfied with the OnePlus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless Earphones. The bombastic bass, comfortable fit, and solid battery life make them a great choice for music lovers like me. While there are a few drawbacks, such as limited controls and no active noise cancellation, they don’t detract significantly from the overall experience. If you're looking for affordable earphones that deliver impressive sound quality, I definitely recommend giving these a try!","Phone pass me thaa - Bluetooth connect thaa

I’ve worn these headphones for hours without any discomfort, which speaks to their ergonomic design.

Microphone and Controls
The built-in microphone and inline controls are a convenient addition. The mic quality is clear, making it easy to take calls on the go. The inline control button allows you to play/pause music, answer/end calls, and skip tracks, all without having to reach for your device. This functionality adds a lot of convenience, especially when multitasking.

Durability and Portability
Despite their lightweight design, the boAt BassHeads 100 headphones feel sturdy and well-made. The tangle-free cable is a significant advantage, as it prevents knots and makes the headphones easy to carry in a pocket or bag. The compact size and included carry pouch further enhance their portability, making them a great choice for travel and everyday use.

Would I recommend this product? Absolutely! If you’re in the market for affordable, high-quality in-ear headphones with a strong bass response and convenient features, the boAt BassHeads 100 is an excellent choice.","Good product at this price.

I used the same earpiece in mint green colour 4 yrs back and that was very nice. So at this time also I want to buy again.,"Good and quite comfortable. The ear buds nicely fit into my ears. They do not slip out from my ears. Sound quality is not the best, but good in this price range. A ""Go"" for it 👍","A very basic 90's earphones, was a gift to my boyfriend, he loved it.","Everything available within this price.
(case, pouch, band, extra buds, 1 year warranty)

Looks good, not bulging ear buds, comfortable, lightweight and very small.

sound clarity is not bad and average.
material is not that good quality.
no bass sounds.
included more than of the price.

Not sure about the lasting and sustainability. but not expecting much with this price.

one year warranty is appreciative.
for simple use and lite music uses,
please go for it 👍🏻",The product is good but not suitable for Realme phones (especially the Realme 9 Pro Plus). Have to turn ON the OTG connection again and again after 10 min. Sound is loud and good.,"Value for money product:

- Sound quality is good.
- Cable quality and length are also satisfactory.
- Deep bass for a great music experience.","Nice product but sometimes if your listen music for long time, it's make little pain in ears. Overall good product","Worth the price

Still, satisfied with the product","A bit less on the comfy side. Sometimes you might hear noises if wire gets rubbed against a surface. Would recommend buying another one that costs around 500. As the above issue isn't present there. Why I bought this? Just to try it out, since I already have the other one.",Avarage...,Good product value for money,good item,"I bought this for my brother and he said it's good for the price. He used it for almost 2 years until the inner wires gave up and broke. He would usually put it in his bag coiled up in the provided pouch. He could still use it even after the outer skin of the cable broke and hubg around. The sound quality is decently bass-y and clear, it is really good for 299₹ (actually bought it for 199 after 100₹ coupon discount). It's lightweight and can be used with any tablet, laptop and phone with a 3.5mm jack. The cable skin does not melt like it does on those Samsung earphones that cost 400-500₹. If you're on a tight budget then get this. It can go a long way if stored well and not used roughly.","This is a Type C earphone that works great with my Samsung smartphone, having no 3.5 mm earphone jack. It has a clear bass and great overall sound quality, which is why, the product is named like that. Volume controls, microphone and multi function key are integrated with the earphone. Since this is a WIRED earphone for the old school individuals like me, therefore nothing can be shared about battery life. The wire has a rubbery feel to the touch, and durability is to be checked for this in the long term. Will not comment on weight. Type C earphones support digital audio signal only, so exchange of audio digitally through the Type C port has to be enabled first.",Good bass this price value,Worth to buy,good but mobile work slow,Good,"I got this product 440/- (400 product+ 40 delivery charges), price is too high,
I wantedly purchased for someone asked to purchase.

Quality is super superrrr😍, but price ☹️",Nice,"If some one searching for wired boat headphone in low price, here it is. Low bass, life time-one year. Good product btw.",Good sound and performencr,"Good product,Value for Money",Good sound best for gaming wired Little bit weak,Been using since 5 years and still works good. I bought another pair for my mom and she’s been using it quite alright since long time. Sound quality and clarity is average but really durable.,"The mic quality is poor. The person on the other end hears my voice as if I'm speaking from far away, even though the microphone is close to my mouth. Otherwise, the product is worth it for 500 rupees.",Average product sound and also quality is also average price is also 300 but I think 200 and 150 vali sound quality hai i will recommend realme wird 2 earphones mai pahale vahi use kia hai 3 saal ab Jake ek earphones nikal gaya to kharidane pade kash isame return hota to boat ke ye return karata but nahi hai ha unaka price 600 hai but they are 10 times better then these but if you want budget friendly then you can go with this vo out of stock the to ye kharide Maine,Good,"These earphones offer fantastic value for money, making them a great choice for music lovers on a budget.

Pros:
1. Impressive Sound Quality: The bass performance is exceptional, delivering a rich and immersive audio experience. Whether I’m listening to music or watching videos, the sound quality is clear and powerful.
2. Stylish Design: The Furious Red color gives these earphones a bold and attractive look. They stand out, and I appreciate the sleek design that complements my style.
3. Comfortable Fit: The in-ear design comes with multiple ear tips, allowing me to find the perfect fit. They stay securely in place, even during workouts or long listening sessions.
4. Built-in Microphone: The mic works well for phone calls and voice commands. The sound quality during calls is clear, making conversations easy and hassle-free.
5. Tangle-Free Cable: The cable is made from a durable material that resists tangling, which is a huge plus for me. It makes storage and transport much more convenient.
6. Affordable Price: Given their performance and quality, these earphones are very reasonably priced. They offer great value compared to many other brands in the market.

Cons:
1. Limited Noise Isolation: While the earphones provide decent passive noise isolation, they may not completely block out external sounds in noisy environments. Users seeking a more immersive experience might want to consider noise-canceling options.
2. Cable Durability: Although the cable is tangle-free, it might be prone to wear and tear with heavy usage. Care should be taken to avoid pulling or bending it excessively.
3. Sound Signature: The bass-heavy sound signature may not be suitable for everyone, particularly those who prefer a more balanced sound profile. It might overpower mids and highs in certain music genres.
4. No Inline Controls: While the microphone is handy for calls, there are no inline controls for volume or playback, which can be inconvenient for some users.

Overall:
The boAt Bassheads 100 in Ear Wired Earphones (Furious Red) are an excellent choice for anyone seeking quality sound and comfort at an affordable price. With impressive bass, a stylish design, and a comfortable fit, they’re perfect for daily use. Despite minor drawbacks like limited noise isolation and sound signature, I highly recommend them for anyone looking for budget-friendly earphones that deliver great performance!",Good as expected 💥💥,It hurt ears after some time,"Timing supply, and package are very well","My second purchase of boat earphones and they are just as good as before. Did like the Velcro and pouch, it was well needed. But the pouch quality should be bit more increased. The pouch also sticks to the Velcro put around earphones when kept inside. Otherwise all good!","This is a very good product. I am a big fan of Joseph Vijay. I listen to his songs in morning, afternoon and Evening. I also listen to his songs in night while dreaming. This has a very good effect. It will affect your soul. So buy this and enjoy.",Ok ok,Sound quality is good but don't comfort in ear.,"Sound - 4/5 (too much bass)
Mic - 3/5 (decent)
Build - 3/5 (could be better)

The things it don't have -
1) Breaded cable
2) Angle jack
3) Gold plating
4) A good tuning (everything is bass heavy which is not ideal) (manual EQ needed for good audio)

The things I like -
1) Bass (obviously)
2) Loudness
3) Cheap (Rs. 298 on sale)
4) No latency (obviously)
5) Pouch",Worth for money,"Highs - 5/5
Mids - 4/5
Bass - 3/5","As per the price of the product it's good. Sound, bass, clarity is pretty impressive. But the quality of the wire is ordinary.",Being using it for 4-6 months no issue,feel good till now,Mediocre performance. Those who have small ear canal don't buy. It hurts just after 10 mins of wearing. Sound quality just ok.,Product nice but before you buy please check your earphone insert pin,"Mic will be too far, otherwise it's okish",Itam orihnal received but bass quality low,Ear phones are good but cannot mute the mike.,Very Good,Not good go for other,"Awesome but seems now the phone company have moved to not used these, but this is the best thing you will use.",Not good,Ok ok product,Abg,mic not as good as I was expecting.,"Good earphone. 1 star less because mic not in-line.

It's sound quality is good not best but good and comfortable too if u want to buy u can it is worth it absolutely. And I have cut 2 stars because of delay of delivery of 2 times.,"The headphone's sound is mind-blowing, sound are very sweet and bass are heavy. The vocal is moderate, The design is amazing 😍","not made for calling, your voice is not audible to another person","Good quality, good sound 👍",Good speaker,Good,"Mashaallah🥰 i am frend gift

I love Boat company.❤️
Brand.Boat company",So so. Not comfortable. Although audio quality is good.,"In this price segment,there are so many in ear wired earphones but these are the best.Comfort is good but not for more than 3 or 4 hours of listening.Fuctionality is too good.Performance is also very good.Fit and volume control is also good. But one thing that I doesn't like is thing that boat is mentioning that it has a extra bass. But it doesn't has that extra bass that producer has mentioned. If you want that extra bass please go towards the realme buds 2 way better than this. Because of the bass problem,I have given it a 4 star rating. Overall it is a good product excluding bass. I hope this review will help you 🙏.",Wire is thin and it has more changes to damage.this price quality is nice..bass is low. Good for gaming,"They dont make them like how they used to make it before
The older earphones of the same model were rich in bass and sound quality than this",Good quality in budget segment! Using it for 12 months,Good,After 3 months it stopped working one side but i claimed warranty they replaced it it's been 4 months now no issues,"Says 'Super Extra Bass' but sounds like any other affordable wired earphones. Sound is crisp and clear and bass is also quite audible, but not to a point where it's 'Super Extra Bass'. They're also quite comfortable to the ears when using which is good and they give a small little pouch to keep the earphones. In conclusion, the product is affordable, sounds good (not excellent) and comfortable to the ears.",Value for money product with superior quality sound and build,Good,"I’ve been using these wired earphones for a couple of weeks now, and overall, I’m really happy with my purchase. The sound quality is excellent, with clear highs, balanced mids, and surprisingly good bass for earphones in this price range. They work perfectly for both music and calls, and the in-line microphone is clear and picks up my voice without any issues.

My only complaint is that the ear tips could be a bit more comfortable. After a few hours of use, they start to feel a bit tight in my ears. Luckily, swapping out the tips for a different size helped a little, but it’s still not perfect.

Overall, these earphones deliver great performance and value for the price. I’d definitely recommend them if sound quality is your top priority.",Earpiece or buds aren't comfortable. You must follow Earpiece degine from oneplus neckband or your own tws.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
B0C8JB3G5W,4.2,"best wireless earphones for 1600. very sleek look with curved edges and lightweight which makes them very comfortable to wear. 3 sizes of the rubber buds are provided suiting any size of ear. call quality is good with a decent mic which works well even in a windy environment. very easy to use with touch controls. the battery is the most impressive in them. i charged them fully when i first opened them (approximately 3 months ago) and since then ive been using them for an hour daily, still didnt have to charge them again till date. the only issue is the app for customization, which is only available in android and not in iphone. overall a good product with excellent sound quality and immersive bass. you should definitely go for it under 2000.","The OnePlus Buds 2R offer impressive value at their price point. The design is sleek and comfortable, making them easy to wear for extended periods. They also feel durable and well-made, which adds to their overall appeal.

The sound quality is moderately good—clear and balanced for casual listening, though audiophiles might find it lacking in depth or bass. Still, for everyday use, they perform well and provide a satisfying experience.

Overall, these earbuds are a great choice if you’re looking for an affordable option with a stylish design and decent sound quality. Definitely worth considering!","1. Since 2023 September, they have been dropped in toilets and water buckets and forgotten in washing machines multiple times. They still work. I use them 3-4 hours a day easily. They last a good 4-5 days on the box charge for me. For their physical endurance alone they are worth the cost.
2. Noise cancellation is decent. Not the best good enough for the price.
3. Easily to connect across two devices.
4. Touch control is great.
5. They have a tendency to drop from ears but thankfully I am not tall enough for them to suffer serious damage.
6. A year and half of heavy and neglectful use, the sound is great and the battery lasts long.","Comfortable. Sound quality good.The buds are really comfortable and easy to fit in the ear. The design itself is very sleak, modern and stylish.",Great product with good battery backup and very balanced sound but lacks 2 important features like dual connectivity and low latency for gaming if you are buying for gaming purpose better to skip this but for multimedia it is the best sound experience you can get in this price range,Very good sound quality. Touch buttons work very good. Easy to pair,"I recently bought these EarPods, and while they offer good sound quality and comfort, there’s one major issue – sound leakage. When the volume is increased, people around me can hear the music, which can be annoying in quiet places like offices or public transport.","I’m a big fan of headphones—some might even call it an obsession. Since this is one of my favorite areas in electronics, expect a detailed review.

Before diving in, I believe in establishing benchmarks, as comparing products helps assess their performance effectively.

I own at least one headphone from every category—not meant as a brag, but to highlight my passion for varied content consumption.

So, why did I choose these?

It was a tough choice between the Oppo Enco Buds 2 and these, with the main differences being price and some features. Ultimately, I opted for these because for just a little more, I get IP55 rating and a larger driver.

That said, a larger driver doesn’t necessarily mean better sound.

Previously, I was using Skullcandy Spoke, which many enthusiasts might recognize as quite muted. You have to crank the volume above 70% to catch all the details, and they’re nearly inaudible outdoors. So even if the OnePlus turns out to be a poor choice, at least I won't be stuck with earbuds that lack volume.

Likes:

Excellent design—sturdy and not flimsy.
Good sound quality for the price.
Long battery life, though not the best in class.
Stem design looks nice and fits snugly.
Quick switch feature is a plus.

Dislikes:

Missing features like a functional game mode and volume controls on the earbuds.
Accidental touches when putting them on or taking them off—not a deal-breaker, but common in the industry.
Concern about losing the buds during physical activities.
More customization options in the app would be appreciated.
Strangely, the large ear tips fit worse than the medium ones, even though I used the larger tips with my OnePlus neckband.","Sounds good for now
I hope it's last for long with this quality",Good,Average sound quality.,Good,Good item,Best product.,Product is very good. Battery backup is best.,Sound is good and while speaking mis quality is ok not good battery capacity is good,Great product.

Due to one plus I bought it but yeah good I can say.,"Sound Quality is very good
Nice option under ₹2k",Good sound.,"The product is good in quality and durability.
I could go for 5 star rating but slight compromise on sound and rare time facing issues to charge the earphones in the AirPods after few attempts it gets charged.",Working fine. Sound quality is good for the price.,Quite descent under this price range,Good sound quality.,"Bought it for Rs.1600 during sales. I must say this earbuds are good under 2k as it's a known brand secondly sound quality is clear with noise cancellation as mentioned. One thing that amazed me is the battery backup. I mostly used it to watch current affairs, educational purposes, calling,etc so, it serves the purpose for me. Definately recommend it to buy. If you are looking for same.","I just have to give this thing a 5-star just for the amount of abuse it has taken. I've owned it for about six months and I use it daily for 2-4 hours. I throw this thing on the ground daily(not intentionally), steet, tiles, grass, you name it. Still works like a charm. It's the Nokia of earbuds.",best quality,"Value for money ,color, connectivity, Fit, Compatibility, Ease of use","**Review:**
I recently purchased the OnePlus Buds 2R, and after using them extensively for a month, I feel confident in sharing my detailed review. These earbuds are an excellent addition to OnePlus’s audio lineup, offering a mix of stellar sound quality, impressive battery life, and a comfortable fit. Below, I will discuss various aspects including design, comfort, sound quality, battery life, connectivity, and overall value.

**Design and Comfort:**
The OnePlus Buds 2R boast a minimalist and sleek design. They come in a compact, oval-shaped charging case that easily fits in pockets and bags. The earbuds themselves have a matte finish which adds a premium touch and makes them less prone to fingerprints.

In terms of comfort, the OnePlus Buds 2R are exceptionally light and fit snugly in the ear. They come with multiple sizes of silicone ear tips, ensuring a secure and comfortable fit for different ear shapes. I’ve worn them for extended periods without experiencing any discomfort, making them ideal for long listening sessions or workouts.

**Sound Quality:**
The sound quality of the OnePlus Buds 2R is where these earbuds truly shine. They are equipped with 10mm dynamic drivers that deliver a rich and balanced sound profile. The bass is punchy without being overwhelming, the mids are clear and well-defined, and the highs are crisp and detailed. Whether I was listening to music, podcasts, or watching movies, the audio performance was consistently excellent.

Additionally, the OnePlus Buds 2R support Dolby Atmos, which significantly enhances the spatial audio experience, providing a more immersive sound. The passive noise isolation, while not as effective as active noise cancellation, does a decent job of blocking out ambient noise, making them suitable for use in various environments.

**Battery Life:**
Battery life is another strong point for the OnePlus Buds 2R. On a full charge, the earbuds provide up to 7 hours of continuous playback, and the charging case offers an additional 30 hours of battery life. The case supports fast charging, and just 10 minutes of charging provides up to 10 hours of playback time, which is incredibly convenient for those on the go.

**Connectivity:**
The OnePlus Buds 2R feature Bluetooth 5.2, ensuring a stable and reliable connection. Pairing the earbuds with my devices was seamless, and I didn’t experience any dropouts or connectivity issues during use. They also support Fast Pair, making it quick and easy to connect to OnePlus smartphones and other compatible devices. The touch controls are responsive and intuitive, allowing me to manage playback, adjust volume, and access voice assistants with ease.

**Additional Features:**
The OnePlus Buds 2R come with a few noteworthy features that enhance the overall user experience. They are IP55 rated, meaning they are resistant to dust and water splashes, making them suitable for workouts and outdoor activities. Additionally, the earbuds have a low latency mode, which is particularly beneficial for gaming and watching videos, ensuring audio and video sync perfectly.

**Conclusion:**
Overall, the OnePlus Buds 2R offer exceptional value for their price. They combine high-quality sound, impressive battery life, and a comfortable fit, making them a great choice for both casual listeners and audiophiles. While they lack active noise cancellation, the passive noise isolation is adequate for most environments. If you’re looking for reliable and high-performing earbuds without breaking the bank, the OnePlus Buds 2R are definitely worth considering.

**Pros:**
- Excellent sound quality with balanced audio profile
- Impressive battery life with fast charging
- Comfortable and secure fit
- Reliable connectivity with Bluetooth 5.2
- IP55 rating for dust and water resistance
- Low latency mode for gaming and videos

**Cons:**
- No active noise cancellation
- Limited color options

I highly recommend the OnePlus Buds 2R for anyone in search of high-quality, affordable wireless earbuds.

I'm very much happy with the purchase.,"it's been over a year since I bought it and it was a good purchase, can be used for good time before you recharge, quality of music is great.
Mic is average for calls..
The only issue I am facing currently is -
A good number of times when I put them away in the box, they still stay connected to the device instead of switching off and charging, and will drain the battery if it is not noticed.","I got the OnePlus Nord 2r as my first Oneplus product and I was doubting if it will be worth the ₹1,699 spent.
But it exceeded my expectations with the sound quality.
The entire build is hard plastic only but they are very sturdy even if it falls down.

The sound quality is what impressed me the first time I use them. Music feels great to hear and this is for bass lovers.

Battery backup is great easily we can get 1 daytime full. (7-8 hrs of music)

It also fits perfectly without any disturbance even if wearing for long time, we don't feel anything.

So if you are looking best phone in battery performance and everything under 21-22k go ahead for IQOO Z9 S . You will be always happy to buy this phone . And last point phone is very sexy slim. I only disappointed with amazon delivery services","1. Look wise premium as curved AMOLED 120 Hz display and curved back pannel provided. 5/5
2. Camera decent rating 4/5
3. Battery 5500 mah lasting 1.5 day for heavy users and charged 💯 % in 50 minutes. 5/5

Everything is good like battery , display,camera , processor etc
And delivery of Amazon is also good.","The device is the absolute best when it comes to being overall balanced in all sectors, within the 20k price range. The gaming isnt bad at all, easily 60+ fps on high settings in most games.. smooth experience overall with 120hz refresh rate and very nice 4k support. Enjoyable 5500 mah battery. Extended use may cause a little bit of heating as in my personal case but other than that, the phone charges in about an hour from 0 to 100 and the backup lasts for a day and a half. Only thing i would change in this phone is a little heating issue. Go for it under 20k.","Really very good, I have purchased it to my dad. Very light weight, battery stays long, camera is really outstanding. I have checked all other phone in this price no phone can beat this. I loved it.

Decent Battery Back-up
It could have better with gorilla glass protection & flat screen

(Please Provide Customers with 2 option Flat Sceeen & Curved Screen)

Everything else is superb in this price range i usually don't write any review but for this product in wanted to write !

😃 Buy it you won't regret","This is my first iqoo device and i must say its amazing. There are more pros in device than cons and I must say no other phone can beat this in this particular price segment.
Design and Build (9/10)-
The phone feels quite sleek and comfortable in hand. Weighing just about 180g and about 7.5mm thick. This phone is by far the slimmest and lightest 5500Mah phone I have ever seen. Even slimmer and slighter than many 5000Mah phone is the market. Ther design language is taken from newly launched Vivo v40 series and this phone is exact replica or little toned down version of Vivo V40e. So you are getting a 28k V40e phone under 20k. A sweet deal right.

Display(8.5/10) -- The display is a typical 120Hz, Oled panel with deep black and around 1000 nits of peak brightness which is more than enough in outdoor environment. Colours are punchy and crisp. You get different colour modes which you can set as per your taste.

Camera (9/10)- Camera is just outstanding. I have never seen such an amazing low light performance from any 15-20k phones in the recent times. The camera balances light very well and even in backlite situation the photos are amazing. The 2x potraits are awesome coupled with various background bokeh modes. Colours are good and dynamic range is fantastic. This phone is camera beast in 18k and I must say Well done Iqoo. They focused on giving 1 very good camera rather than two or three average cameras. Many brands give useless 8MP wide angle camera and mediocre primary camera in this range. If wide angle is your priority than you can go with Iqoo z9s pro model.

Performance(9/10)--
This phone can handle days to day task very smoothly with no zitter or lag. Games run smoothly and 60 fps constant in BGMI.
Not much cpu throttling or heating issue seen so far. This phone has antutu of around 700k which is very good for mid rangers under 20k.

Battery (10/10)--
Battery is just another major USP of this phone. I don't know how they were able to provide such high quality 5500mah battery in such a slim and lightweight phone. The battery backup in normal usage with 120Hz and 5g enable is around 12 Hours(SOT) and if you disable 120Hz and use Wifi the SOT can reach as high as 16Hours(Look at the screenshot). Mind blowing right?. I too was shocked when I used this phone full 2 days with sot of 16 hours. For gamers this can last about 7-8 hours of continuous gaming and for casual users like me easily 1.5 to 2 days on wifi and 1.5 days on 5g. No heating issues while charging and time taken for full charge is 1hour with 45W vivo flash charger.

Software and other features (7/10)--
The funtouch os 14 though very feature rich is not regarded among the top skins in android world but I must say funtouch has been improving a lot in past 3-4 years and is slowly adopting to stock android looks. The main issue which I faced is animation are not very smooth and UI elements lack a consistency in design language (edit-After funtouch OS15 ui is very smooth and animation are silky smooth now). Sometimes minimising an app shows double animation. Btw I have not faced any hanging issue in this phone. Bloatware are present and many can't be disabled as well like vstore,vivo browser jovi home etc. color os or realme os atleast allow user to disable such bloatwares. Vivo should introduce origin os in India as well. Widgets are very poor and there is no option of big app folders as well(after android 15 feature is added)

Speakers, Haptics and connectivity-
Speakers are stereo and quite loud. Not louder than many realme or moto phones but when increasing the volume boost upto 300 percent the sound is indeed very loud though bass is less.
Haptics are not x axis linear 4d motor which you see in many midrange and flagship these days but normal Ghurr Ghurr type vibration motor. Connectivity is very good no issues with 4g or 5g. Even VoNR is supported in this phone.

Overall it is a very good phone under 20k. Hope all the software optimisations like animation, icons and widgets get polished in funtouch os 15.

Update- After funtouch os 15 update animation is now more smoother than before and new widgets are also added.","So if u want best phone under this range of price this is the best choice. Camera quality is best . I am using this phone since 4 months, their is no any bug or problem related phone this has best camera quality i enjoy taking pictures with it battery is fast chargeable and phone is very smooth and fast for usages. It has best processor very speed their no any heating issue connectivity is quite fast.
Their are 2 drawbacks of this phone that
१. It doesn't have audio jack
२. No ultra wide angle cam","After a long wait, finally I get the oynx green z9s. This is just my first day review, I will update it after a week of usage and then again after one or two months as long term. Now, as a first day usage, I am overall satisfied with the device. Below I am dividing the pros and cons of the phone as per my observation.

Pros:
1. The screen is really good and vibrant, so people will like the big colourful screen for sure.
2. The app animations and other transitions are really smooth.
3. The aura light feature, though feels more like a gimmick, it's a cute touch of added feature, I kind of like it while it lights up with the orange whitish colour.
4. I am happy with the update speed, I mean right after the phone is set up, I got latest security updates of October, whereas many costlier devices couldnot provide a timely update.
5. The sound is also good as per price and the sound boost option does help in noisy conditions.
6. The design is really sleek, even with 5500mah battery, it feels so light to hold, the curved displays in both sides make it even slimmer to hold.

Cons:
1. The 120hz refresh is not optimized fully, I feel like that, I mean in many apps, it's not that smooth, I felt some jitter while scrolling fb, YouTube.
2. I saw frame drops a lot while playing 4k HDR videos in YouTube and 2 to 4 times the app even shuts down on its own.
3. If you are not a person, who likes to tinker around the settings, then you will be disturbed a lot with many notifications. I myself have to manually turned off so many notifications and permissions.
4. Yes, I know the processor is not that powerful, so I request you not to deal with more than 4 apps at a time, basically do it little slowly, otherwise you will feel some lag.
5. The call quality is very average, I mean the sound is very low, even in speaker mood, it feels like a normal call sound.

Now, coming to battery life and camera, this, I have not tested yet, so won't comment now, but from 100 to 69%, as of now I am getting 3.30 hrs of SOT, so let's see, I will update after first complete discharge.

This is regarding the battery back up, from 100% to 15%, I got around 10hrs of SOT, without playing games, mostly used fb, insta and lots of HDR and non HDR videos on YouTube, everything with 120hz on. This is after first time charging, now I am mainting 95-30% charging cycle, with this I will update after 1month. Photos are coming soon.

After one month update, I am still getting close to 7.30 to 8 hours of SOT, it hardly heats up, the only thing I encounter is, sometimes it feels laggy, this is probably due to ufs 2.2, rest everything is fine.

After the Android 15 based funtouch os 15 update, I am getting around 10.30 hrs of SOT, with variable screen refresh rate. This is not continuous test, rather, it's my normal day to day usage with 6 hours of sleep time at night. Animations are a bit smoother than previous versions.

The 8hrs 54 minutes screen on time (SOT) is after Android 15 update and 65% on 5g network and 35% on wifi. Jan 3, 2025.",Good phone value of money.,Good mobile,Very very smart phone so like it IQ z9s Mobail,"Ek khwahish thi ye curve display mobile lene ki...

After all that (15hrs of uses), the battery just drained to 25%, which is really good...

Additionally, they are durable and often come with water and sweat resistance, making them ideal for workouts or outdoor use. Overall, they provide excellent value for the price, though audiophiles may seek more premium options. The Boat earphones stand out in the budget segment for their impressive sound clarity and punchy bass, appealing to users who enjoy a more bass-heavy audio experience. The earphones often feature passive noise isolation, which helps block out ambient noise, enhancing the listening experience whether you’re commuting or working out. Their ergonomic design ensures a snug and secure fit, with many models offering magnetic earbuds or ear hooks for added convenience.","I am so happy that I bought this!

Their IPX5 water resistance ensures they can handle sweat and light splashes, making them ideal for workouts, commutes, or daily use. The snug in-ear design also helps block out some ambient noise, enhancing the overall listening experience.

In terms of sound quality, the rich bass drivers deliver deep, punchy bass that makes music, movies, and gaming more immersive.

However, for everyday listeners who enjoy bass-heavy audio, these earbuds offer a well-balanced and enjoyable sound profile. Gamers will also appreciate the 45ms low latency mode, which ensures that audio stays in perfect sync with visuals, making for a smooth and responsive gaming experience.

For calls, the Zen Quad Mic ENC technology is designed to improve clarity by reducing background noise. It works effectively in quieter settings, but in noisier environments, it may still pick up some ambient sounds. While it is sufficient for casual conversations and virtual meetings, those who need professional-grade call quality may find it slightly lacking.

One of the standout features of the Z20 Pro is its impressive 60-hour total playtime, a rarity in this price range. This extended battery life makes it an excellent choice for long trips or daily use without the hassle of frequent recharging. The Type-C fast chargingadds another layer of convenience, providing 120 minutes of playtime with just a 10-minute charge, ensuring users can quickly get back to their music or calls.

Connectivity is seamless with Bluetooth 5.3, offering a stable and fast connection across multiple devices. The touch controls are intuitive, allowing users to easily manage playback, volume, and calls without reaching for their phone.

Issues:
❌ Poor Connectivity – Frequent disconnections & lag.

❌ No Seamless Switching – Frustrating for Apple ecosystem users.

Set was working correctly and well after I followed the instruction video to resolve my problem with one of the earbuds. There was no sound and I got the impression that I have received a defective set. The instruction manual should upgrade the quality of instructions by including a first time setup. That both earbuds have to be long touched without tapping to have both the earbuds powered on simultaneously and wait for five seconds to auto sync with each other. Then the pairing with the source device (my android mobile in my case) can be done seamlessly. After that everything worked like a charm. Sound quality is pretty good and so is the battery. 4 stars for an unclear instruction manual.,Pairing issues 😞💔 but product is good,Super,"Hurt my ears after 30 minutes of use.

The sound quality is insane - rich, clear, and the bass is so deep! They're super comfy too, so I can wear them for hours without feeling any discomfort.

The battery life is crazy good - I don't need to charge them every five minutes, which is a total game-changer. And the touch controls? So easy to use! I can answer calls, change tracks, and adjust the volume with just a few taps.

Honestly, I was a bit skeptical about the price, but trust me, these earbuds are WORTH IT. They feel premium, sound amazing, and are ridiculously affordable

If you're in the market for new earbuds, do yourself a favor and grab these!","mujhe ye use karte hue kam se kam 2 saal ho gye abhi tak koi bhi issue nahi aaya
highly recommended to buy this totally worth it",It's ok to use for 1 hour more than that you can't bare headache,"Good and easy to use.

Update on 9 March: Sometimes when I scratch my hair, I accidentally press the ear buds button, so it pauses the video/song.","At first, I was hesitant to order these Boult earpods as they were new to me, and before order i was a bit worried about the quality. But after using them, I’m really impressed! The sound quality is excellent, the bass is deep, and the fit is comfortable. It has exceeded my expectations, and I’m glad I took the chance. Definitely worth it!💥💯✔️",Sound quality is good. But not reliable or you can say not durable for long time. After 6 months one of his side stop working or you low sound getting started. I prefer not to buy this again.,"The Boult W20 earbuds were a big disappointment. The main issue was their unreliable pairing with my phone—it often took several attempts, and even then, the connection would randomly drop. This made them frustrating to use for calls or music. The sound quality was subpar, with distortion at higher volumes, and the bass was inconsistent. Additionally, the battery life fell far short of expectations. Overall, these earbuds failed to deliver on their promises, leaving me regretting the purchase. I’d recommend exploring other options for a better and more reliable experience.","Good, but not pairing properly",Good,"Calling quality is good, light weight sleek nature, listening music hours long... battery may be for 20hrs overall",Average earbuds with bad microphone during calls,Average but good,"Audio quality is okay.

Never had I experiences sound and quality better in other products that I have used. Boult fan for life.,"The Boult Audio W20 Truly Wireless Earbuds offer great value with features like 35 hours of total playtime, 45ms low latency, and an IPX5 water resistance rating. The 13mm bass drivers deliver punchy sound, making them ideal for bass lovers. The Zen™ ENC mic ensures clear calls by reducing background noise, and the Type-C fast charging is convenient. Touch controls and a comfortable fit make them easy to use. However, the sound may not satisfy audiophiles, and noise isolation could be better in very noisy environments. Overall, they're a solid choice for budget-conscious users.","Battery backup is very poor, it claims 35hrs but actually it goes less than 24hrs...
Overall build quality is good but at this price point you can get better options","I purchased wireless earbuds from Amazon on 4th September 2024, It worked well, but for the past few days, I have been facing issues like having less sound even when the volume is at its highest. I also encountered a problem: the music is getting stuck in between. I thought I had a fault with my phone but I have also checked in the mobile shop that the fault is with wireless earbuds.I am writing this email because i have a warranty for 1 year.

B07WHQHNZC,4.2,Nice product reasonable price great performance and battery life,"First impressions:
1. While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.
2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.
3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.
4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.
5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.
6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.
7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.
8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.

Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.

Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.

Update after 2+ weeks of usage:
1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.
2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.
3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.",Excellent mobile in this price range. I brought it for 10.5k. Excellent one at this price range,Awesome product. Worth the money!,"Camera - 4.0/5.0 ( Decent picture quality)
Performance - 4.5/5.0 (Good but not too good )
Display - 4.0/5.0 ( its no amoled so)
Battery - 4.9/5.0 ( 6000mah with 44W charger)
...The bad think is processor only support 60fps and some bloatware in this segment but overall mobile is good for normal users but not for heavy gaming users.","It is 10K mobile in my opinion. Purely chinese product. The mobile rate is high.
Display is okay okay. Mobile sound is good as of now. Camera quality is okay okay.
Design or look is good. Mobile will heat, I have noticsed.",Nice 👍,"In the price range of 10k-12k, it is a very decent mobile phone. The performance is good, and you can play PUBG on this phone. However, the camera quality is not good. You can watch videos in high quality, and both sound and video are decent. I have to say that, in this price range, everything is perfect except the camera.","It's a nice phone at that price, but there are some drawbacks I've personally experienced, like Battery life, camera quality, and performance. The company claims that this phone can have a one-day battery life if we use it for 5 hours per day, but it hardly gets 8 hours of battery life if I use it for just 3 hours. and the camera quality, it's similar to Oppo A59 5G which I use earlier. Yet the picture quality and detailing is better in this phone, but when I compare pictures from both the phones, I can't see much difference in the photos on both the phones. and when it comes to performance, It has so many unnecessary apps which are official for IQOO which I won't use personally, eats so much of storage, like literally 2gb of space, which is of useless for me. Other than these factors, everything is good.",Best phone under this price range. It having 6gb Ram plus dynamic ram extension which is awesome. Camera is better than other phone in this price range. Flash fast charge which is good and battery backup with heavy usage full day easily. Vivo offering best phone in their child company IQOO.

During this period of time I came to know about IQOO and googled the details . I came to know it's the subbrand of Vivo. I was happy.I searched Amazon and fixed IQOO z9x which is budget frndly and having nice basic features.
I was impressed with 6k mah battery backup.I chose dark colour . Storage is only 128gb and the camera is fine not too good. Within this prize range, we cannot expect more.
I'm satisfied with product. Waiting for Indian release of IQOO 13 on dec 5.
After all, I want to point out some cons of this device.
The speakers of this device is compromised.
Receiver of our call can hear our voice beautifuly. No issues. But I feel it's not up to mark for us. There is a limitation and unsatisfaction during calling especially in a town area or a crowd even in full volume.
Next is actual speaker of this device. It needs improvement because the sound played during YouTube or any other video player is unsatisfactory. When compared to my previous redmi device I feel it's not upto mark.
My main unsatisfactory points are related to this device stereo. Others are ok.","I bought this for my son for need basis usage. Good phone with display, speed, lock options.

Built with a rugged, reinforced exterior, it promises to withstand the wear and tear of everyday use. Here’s a long-term review covering the cable’s build quality, charging speed, compatibility, and overall durability over time.

1. Build Quality and Durability

True to its name, the Ambrane Unbreakable 3A cable is constructed to be highly durable. The cable features a braided nylon outer layer, which is resistant to tangling, fraying, and even mild bending. Ambrane claims that this cable can withstand significant bending without internal damage, and in long-term use, this proves mostly true. Users who often experience cable wear and tear will find that the Unbreakable 3A stands up well against regular bending and stress.

The connectors on both ends are reinforced with additional protection where the cable meets the plug, which is usually the first area to break down in most cables. Even after extended use, the connections remain tight, and the cable retains its flexibility without cracking. However, excessive force or rough handling could still wear down the connectors, so some caution is advisable.

2. Charging Speed and Data Transfer

The Ambrane Unbreakable 3A cable supports up to 3A fast charging, making it suitable for devices that require high-power input, such as smartphones, tablets, and even some smaller laptops. When paired with compatible adapters and devices, users report consistently fast charging speeds that meet expectations.

For data transfer, the cable performs well with stable connectivity. It’s USB 2.0, so while it won’t offer the fastest data transfer rates available (compared to USB 3.0 or 3.1), it’s perfectly adequate for transferring files between devices. In daily use, there are no connectivity drops, and the cable maintains a stable connection during data transfer.

3. Compatibility

The Ambrane Unbreakable 3A cable is available in various connector types (such as USB-C to USB-A, Micro-USB to USB-A, etc.), allowing compatibility with a wide range of devices. Most users find it compatible with both Android and iOS devices (depending on the type of cable chosen), as well as other USB-powered gadgets like Bluetooth headphones, power banks, and more.

However, it’s important to pair the cable with a 3A or higher-rated adapter to fully utilize the fast-charging capability. Using lower-rated adapters might lead to slower charging speeds. While it may work with some laptops for charging, it’s best suited for smaller devices, as power-intensive devices may need a USB-C Power Delivery (PD) cable for maximum efficiency.

4. Cable Length and Usability

The cable typically comes in lengths of 1m or 1.5m, giving users flexibility depending on their setup. The length is convenient for various situations, whether you’re charging from a wall socket or a power bank on the go. The nylon braiding also prevents tangling, making it easy to store and pull out without worrying about knots.

Long-term users report that the cable’s flexibility remains intact even after months of use. The braided covering prevents stiffness, which is a common issue with some reinforced cables. This flexibility makes it practical for various uses, from charging in the car to using it on the desk or bed without hassle.

5. Value for Money

The Ambrane Unbreakable 3A cable is priced affordably, especially considering the durability and performance it offers. For users who frequently go through charging cables due to wear and tear, this cable is a cost-effective investment. While it’s slightly more expensive than standard, non-reinforced cables, its longevity justifies the additional cost over time.

Given its build quality, reliable fast-charging support, and overall durability, it represents excellent value, especially if you’re looking to avoid replacing cables every few months.

Pros and Cons Summary

Pros:

Durable, reinforced nylon braiding resists wear and tear

Reliable 3A fast charging for compatible devices

Sturdy connectors with additional reinforcement

Tangling-resistant and flexible

Good value for long-term use

Cons:

Limited data transfer speed (USB 2.0)

Not ideal for high-power devices like larger laptops

Slightly more expensive than basic cables

Conclusion

In conclusion, the Ambrane Unbreakable 3A cable is an excellent choice for anyone needing a durable, fast-charging cable that can withstand heavy use. Over the long term, its build quality and consistent performance make it worth the investment, particularly if you tend to go through cables quickly. Its braided design and reinforced connectors make it a reliable option for day-to-day charging needs and light data transfers. If you’re looking for a strong, well-built cable at a reasonable price, the Ambrane Unbreakable 3A is a solid choice that can easily meet your needs for the long haul.","I recently purchased the Ambrane cable, and it has exceeded my expectations. The build quality is impressive, with a durable and flexible design that feels premium. It's compatible with a wide range of devices, ensuring seamless connectivity. The data transfer speed is excellent, making it perfect for fast charging and transferring large files. The connectors fit snugly into ports, reducing the risk of accidental disconnection. The length of the cable is more than enough, providing enough reach without being too cumbersome.

One downside, however, is that the organizer strap for folding the cable is no longer included. It would've been better if this feature was still provided, as it helps keep the cable tidy and organized. Thickness is balanced makes you feel quality with handiness, braided cable therefore is comfortable, has a very good performance can be used for charging output of 3A with 2.0/3.0 quick charging. You'll genuinely feel the difference.

Overall, the Ambrane cable is a great value for the price. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a high-quality cable that gets the job done without any hassle!","Please why buying these power cables make sure you buy them in single piece I made a mistake by ordering pack of 2 one cable is working fine and one does not working at all when I connect this cable with my phone it shows 8hr+ charging time which is totally unacceptable and the other one which is working fine shows 2hrs of charging to be completed then surely one cable is useless I used the same adaptor while charging even my old cable is working fine and shows 2hrs of charging time. I used one cable in October and when I feel the need I tried to use the other one but it shows no sign of life. Even I can't able to data transfer with that cable.

Note my phone and charging adapter is in fit and fine condition ambrain's one cable charging my phone too and the other one is damaged or what I don't know so please buy them in single piece.",Best cable for type c to type c... Charging speed well,Strong and good quality cable. Around 3ft long.,"I purchased the Ambrane Unbreakable 3A Fast Charging 1.5m Braided Type C Cable with high hopes, especially given its claims of being unbreakable and supporting fast charging. Unfortunately, after just over a month of use, my experience has been far from satisfactory.

Initially, the cable worked well. It charged my devices quickly, and the braided design felt durable. However, after about 5 weeks, the fast charging feature stopped working altogether. Now, it charges at a significantly slower rate, which defeats the purpose of buying a fast-charging cable. I’ve tried using it with different devices and chargers, but the issue persists.

To make matters worse, the cable’s durability is questionable. Despite the ""unbreakable"" claim in the title, the cable now looks worn out, and the braiding has started to fray near the connector. It’s disappointing to see such a decline in quality in such a short time.

While the cable is affordable, I expected it to last longer and maintain its fast-charging capabilities. Sadly, it no longer meets my needs, and I cannot recommend it to others looking for a reliable, long-lasting fast-charging solution.

**Rating: 2/5** – Good for the first month, but not durable or reliable in the long run.",Very useful product in this price range fast charging and length of the cable is also good. 😍,Cable is good.,Nice product,Good qulity,Good,Nice,Perfect one for today's busy life,"I recently bought the **Ambrane Braided Type C Cable (Pack Of 2)** and I am quite satisfied with my purchase. Here are my thoughts after using it for a while:

**Pros:**

1. **Build Quality:** The braided design makes these cables incredibly durable and unbreakable. They feel sturdy and are built to withstand daily wear and tear.
2. **Fast Charging:** With 3A fast charging and Quick Charge 3.0 compatibility, my devices charge quickly and efficiently. It's great for when I'm in a rush and need a quick top-up.
3. **Length:** The 1.5-meter length is perfect. It provides enough flexibility to use my devices comfortably while they're charging.
4. **Data Sync:** The 480Mbps data sync speed is reliable and transfers files quickly between my devices.
5. **Pack of 2:** Having two cables in a single pack is a fantastic deal. I can keep one at home and one in my bag for use on the go.

**Cons:**

1. **Flexibility:** While the braided design adds to the durability, it can make the cable a bit stiff. This is a minor inconvenience, but it's something to consider if you prefer more flexible cables.

Overall, I'm pleased with the **Ambrane Braided Type C Cable** and highly recommend it to anyone in need of a reliable, fast-charging cable. Giving it 4 stars for its great performance and value!","Wire quality looks durable and length is also good nice product, it works well",Good product,Ok,Good,Good quality cable for charging and data transfer purposes.,Great value for money,Wire is unbreakable,Cable quality is good,good cable. valid for money,"Good cable, reasonable price",Doesn’t support carplay,The cable is braided and the quality is good.,"The Appearance of the cable is good with a durable and flexible design that feels premium.

The 1.5-meter length is convenient, but the cable can feel a bit stiff compared to regular rubber-coated ones. Also, since it's a Micro USB, it won’t work for newer USB-C devices.

What I appreciate most about this adapter is its versatility. It supports multiple protocols, including USB 3.0, USB 2.0, and USB 1.1, making it compatible with a wide range of devices.

For just ₹109 its very cheap.","This affordable USB adapter is a fantastic choice for MacBook Pro enthusiasts who need to connect a mouse, external drive, or other USB 2.0 devices. I’ve used it occasionally, and it functions flawlessly without any compatibility issues.

Pros:
✅ Budget-Friendly – A great option for those looking for a cost-effective adapter.
✅ Reliable Performance – Works smoothly with no connection issues.

Cons:

Final Verdict:
If you need a dependable and budget-friendly USB adapter for your MacBook Pro, this is a solid choice. While a more compact design would improve portability, it still offers excellent value at this price.","Works faster.

There's only One customer care center in entire Mumbai which was far away from my town, I had to catch two different trains to reach there.

B0CBTTCJL6,4.1,"I have been a user of OnePlus Bullets wireless earphones for almost 4-5 years now. The very first one I purchased was Bullets Z, then Bullets Z bass edition and Z2 twice. So, a total of 4 bullet series I have purchased as of now.
Regarding the life, it is really quite durable. The very first one I purchased still works really fine. The only thing is you will have to make sure it doesn't break. Until then, it will work really, really good.
Sound, look and everything is good for the price. If you want not very bass boosted sound like boat, this could be the perfect choice for you.

It supports fast charging and has good enough battery life.
Not the most you can expect in the market, but it has a good balance of all the things one might look for when buying a neckband.

Al last, it's the best for calls. Earbuds mics sucks when using it for calls. This will work great even when you will speak very quietly.

It doesn't have noise cancellation in the mics, so it will capture little background noise.
I hope this will help you.

I have attached my first 4.5-year-old neckband pic also, and I am still using it.","There is nothing wrong with the looks of the Bullets Z2, they are actually quite decent looking. They are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. The middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, U shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. The wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. One of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the USB Type C port on the side. You get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. The battery unit has the OnePlus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.

The earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. When the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. The Bullets Wireless Z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. The material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. It also comes with an IP55 rating.
Pairing the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. All you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. You can then look up the buds in the list of Bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. Once connected, the Bullets Z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.

You get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. Now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, OnePlus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. Apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), OnePlus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. You have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. It may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of OnePlus earphones- 12.4mm. The fact that OnePlus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. The earbuds support two audio codecs, SBC and AAC.

As for the audio performance, the Bullets Wireless Z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand’s audio formula in the budget segment. While this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.
If you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the Bullets Wireless Z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.

That said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. We could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. As the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.

They come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. But because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.
The Bullets Wireless Z2 also face some heat from the likes of Oppo Enco M32 and the Realme Buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are actually a great proposition for the price; you only need to have a liking for bass.","If you're on the lookout for a solid pair of wireless earphones, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 might just catch your eye. I've been using them for a while, and here's my honest take on what they have to offer.

Connectivity & Ease of Use:

Let’s start with one of the essentials—connectivity. The OnePlus Bullets Z2 nails it with seamless Bluetooth connectivity that just works. Pairing them with my phone was as simple as it gets, and once connected, they stay that way without any annoying drops. The button placement on the neckband is intuitive, and after a day or two of use, I could easily control playback without needing to glance down, thanks to muscle memory. It’s the kind of convenience you don’t realize you need until you have it.

Sound Quality - Balanced Yet Personal:

Now, onto the sound quality. As someone who values a balanced sound signature, I found the Z2 to be a great match for my taste. Whether I'm listening to some mellow jazz, electronic beats, or even rock, the sound remains well-rounded and crisp. The highs, mids, and lows don't overpower each other, making it perfect for those who don't want their ears blasted with bass or overwhelmed by treble.

That said, sound quality is a subjective experience, and preferences can vary widely. If you're a bass head looking for those earth-shaking lows, you might find these a tad restrained. But if, like me, you appreciate a balanced output across genres, these will hit the right notes for you.

Battery Life & Quick Charging - A Week of Peace:

Battery life is another highlight. With moderate use—think about 1-2 hours daily—you can stretch a single charge to last an entire week. Even if you’re a heavy listener, using them for 6-8 hours straight, they can hold up for around 2-3 days before needing a recharge. And the quick charge feature is a lifesaver—just 10 minutes of charging gets you 2-4 hours of extra playtime, which is perfect for those “oops, I forgot to charge them” moments.

Gaming & Low Latency - Smooth Experience:

I spend a fair bit of time playing games like BGMI, and the low latency mode on the Bullets Z2 makes a noticeable difference. There's minimal lag between the visuals and the audio, which makes for a much more immersive gaming experience. It's not just about the sound being clear; it's also about it being on time, and these earphones deliver that pretty well.

Comfort & Passive Noise Isolation:

Comfort is key when it comes to neckbands, and the Z2 doesn’t disappoint. They come with multiple earbud sizes, so you can pick the one that fits snugly for you. While there’s no active noise cancellation (ANC) here, you can achieve a decent level of passive noise isolation by choosing the right ear tips. This makes a noticeable difference in cutting out background noise during commutes or at the office.

App Experience & Annoying Blinking Light:

Now, onto a couple of quirks. The Bullets Z2 uses the HeyMelody app, which offers additional features like custom sound settings. However, my unit just wouldn’t connect with the app, which was a bummer. So, any fancy tweaks you could make through the app were out of my reach, and I had to rely solely on the default Bluetooth pairing. While everything worked smoothly once connected, I feel like I missed out on some customization options that might have enhanced my experience.

Another thing that bugged me was the small white light that blinks when the neckband is connected to a device. It might not seem like a big deal, but if you’re using the earphones in a dark room or while lying down, that blinking light can be pretty distracting. Plus, it probably drains the battery a bit, albeit a small amount. A simple option to turn this off in the app would’ve been a nice touch.

Final Thoughts - A Solid Pick for Most, with Room for Improvement:

Overall, the OnePlus Z2 delivers where it matters—good sound quality, reliable connectivity, and battery life that won’t have you constantly reaching for the charger. It’s not perfect, especially with the blinking light and app connectivity issues, but those are minor compared to the solid performance it offers. Plus, with the quick-charge feature and low-latency gaming experience, it’s hard not to appreciate the value you get.

If you’re looking for a reliable neckband that blends style, comfort, and balanced audio, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 is definitely worth considering. It might not satisfy those who crave earth-shattering bass, but for most listeners, it's a worthy contender at its price point.","Bought it over a year ago and still works great. The highs and lows are great for a headphone of this cost. Podcast and audible, TEDX listening is also great. Conferencing over PCs is also a breeze. I have 8 headphones with blue tooth but this gives no interference and works stable. GREAT blue tooth range, has problems when you are in 2nd floor and your device is in 1st or ground floor.

This product get so many checkboxes right, while it is not the BEST audio headphone for songs or movies but the ANC feature gets you immersive sound, this also helps a lot when attending calls. There is a slight discomfort for fitting into the ears but with adjusting it this would be fine, This is not a headphone that you can sleep with.
Charging is a little bit slow but that 5-10 mins extra should not be a problem. It easily charges up for almost 80% in 20 mins and comes for 2-2.5 days for a person like who uses it for 6 hours straight everyday. This is not the type of earphone for bikers or during biking though the sound is great but this gets super uncomfortable with helmet on.
These earbuds are highly functional. Though earphones like bose give better sound quality but die on you faster either losing charge or break due to higher maintenance.
This is also a great headphones for gym but it depends how you fix it into your ear as it may fallout of place often. It somehow is greatly sweat resistant and can be used in tougher scenarios.
The loudness is apt. There are 2 or atleast one firmware updates you will get.and once you are version 11.3 you are good to go.
It does not work with some tablets especially with xiaomi pad 6, it could also be a failure from the tablets side. Works well with laptops: tested on windows, mac and ubuntu, fedora linux systems. Also tested with HP ASUS MSI, did not test with lenovo and dell.
The only better buds I found that are as functional as these is the realme wireless buds 3 as it seems to connect with every device. There is usually no reason to avoid this if you enjoy listening to metal or operatic music or jazz or soul or RnB and great for hindustani and carnatic music. Above average for gaming sounds, please avoid if you are chatting over a online game like dota, valorant, fortnite. But for me it worked great on league of legends, acceptable in cs:go, battlefield and I noticed that it works better for PC games rather than extended mobile games. Otherwise it is a great functional headphone. With magnetic shut off you have to careful that if you remove it out for anything it would disconnect.

In my case it works well as a all rounder except for some tabs, I had no problem wih iPad, one plus and realme tabs --- DOES NOT WORK ON XIAOMI TAB 6 BUT FINE WITH REDMI TAB, DID NOT TEST FOR LENOVO AND SAMSUNG.
If you want a pure TWS use the one plus buds 2r, but the sound quality of this headphone is a notch better though.

Please only avoid these earphones if you have a short neck or heavily fat from double chinas the wires cause interference and fall off often even if the grip is good.","I recently purchased the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC Bluetooth in-ear earphones, and I'm really impressed with their performance. The 45dB Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation works wonders in blocking out external noise, which makes the listening experience immersive, whether I'm traveling or just relaxing at home.

The sound quality is top-notch with the 12.4 mm drivers providing rich, clear, and booming bass. It's perfect for all kinds of music genres, from bass-heavy tracks to vocals and instrumental tunes.

What I really appreciate is the fast charging feature – just 10 minutes of charging gives me 20 hours of music playback, which is incredible for daily use. The battery life of up to 28 hours is also impressive, making it perfect for long trips or workdays.

The design is sleek and comfortable, fitting snugly in the ears without feeling heavy or uncomfortable, even after hours of use. The mic works well for calls, and the Bluetooth connectivity is stable with minimal interruptions.

Overall, the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC earphones offer great value for the price. If you're looking for a pair of earphones with amazing sound quality, comfort, and solid battery life, I highly recommend them!","The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is the latest addition to OnePlus' lineup of wireless earphones, offering significant upgrades over its predecessors. These in-ear Bluetooth earphones feature Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) up to 45dB, bombastic bass driven by 12.4mm drivers, and a long-lasting battery life, all packed into an ergonomic design. With just 10 minutes of charging, you get up to 20 hours of music playback, making it an excellent choice for those who need a reliable and powerful audio device on the go. The product is available in the striking ""Grand Green"" color, adding a touch of style to its functional design.

### Design and Build Quality

The design of the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC reflects a balance between aesthetics and practicality. The ""Grand Green"" color gives it a unique, vibrant look that stands out without being overly flashy. The earphones are constructed from high-quality materials, ensuring durability while maintaining a lightweight profile.

**Neckband Design:**
The neckband design is both flexible and sturdy, making it comfortable for long-term wear. The earphones are designed to fit snugly in the ears, which is crucial for effective noise cancellation and bass response. The magnetic earbuds are a convenient feature, allowing the earphones to snap together when not in use, which prevents tangling and conserves battery by automatically pausing playback.

**Ergonomics:**
Ergonomics play a key role in the overall user experience of these earphones. The earbuds are designed to fit comfortably in the ear canal, providing a secure fit that helps to block out external noise even when the ANC is turned off. The lightweight neckband rests comfortably on the shoulders without causing discomfort, making these earphones suitable for extended use.

**Build Quality:**
The build quality of the Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is commendable. The materials used feel premium, and the buttons on the neckband are tactile and responsive. The device is also IP55-rated, meaning it is resistant to dust and water splashes, making it suitable for workouts and outdoor use.

### Sound Quality

One of the standout features of the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is its sound quality, particularly the bass. The 12.4mm dynamic drivers are larger than what is typically found in wireless earphones, and this translates to a rich, deep bass response that is ideal for bass-heavy genres like EDM, hip-hop, and pop.

**Bass Response:**
The bass on these earphones is described as ""bombastic,"" and rightly so. The 12.4mm drivers deliver a powerful low-end that doesn’t overshadow the mids and highs but rather complements them. The bass is punchy and clear, providing a satisfying thump that many users will appreciate, especially during workouts or while commuting.

**Mid and High Frequencies:**
The midrange is well-represented, with vocals and instruments coming through clearly without being drowned out by the bass. The highs are crisp and detailed, offering a balanced sound signature that is versatile enough for various music genres. However, some audiophiles might find the emphasis on bass slightly overpowering for more acoustic or classical tracks.

**Active Noise Cancellation:**
The Hybrid ANC technology in the Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is capable of reducing ambient noise by up to 45dB. This feature works exceptionally well in environments with consistent background noise, such as on public transport or in a busy office. The ANC feature not only enhances the listening experience by minimizing distractions but also allows for lower volume levels, which can help in reducing ear fatigue over time.

### Battery Life

Battery life is another area where the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC excels. The earphones offer up to 28 hours of total battery life on a full charge, which is more than sufficient for daily use. This endurance makes them ideal for long commutes, travel, or extended use throughout the day.

**Fast Charging:**
One of the most impressive aspects of these earphones is their fast charging capability. With just 10 minutes of charging, you can get up to 20 hours of playback time. This feature is particularly useful for those who are often on the move and need a quick top-up before heading out. The full charge time is also relatively short, allowing the earphones to be fully charged in less than an hour.

**Usage with ANC:**
When using ANC, the battery life is understandably reduced, but it still remains impressive. With ANC turned on, you can expect around 18 to 20 hours of playback, which is still above average compared to other wireless earphones in the market. The battery life makes these earphones highly reliable, reducing the need for frequent recharges.

### Connectivity and Controls

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC offers seamless connectivity with Bluetooth 5.0, ensuring a stable connection with minimal latency. The earphones are easy to pair with both Android and iOS devices, although they work particularly well with OnePlus smartphones, which can unlock additional features like quick pairing and battery status notifications.

**Latency:**
For those who enjoy gaming or watching videos on their mobile devices, low latency is a crucial factor. The Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC performs well in this regard, with minimal lag that ensures audio syncs well with video content. This makes them suitable not just for music but also for multimedia consumption.

**Controls:**
The inline controls on the neckband are intuitive and easy to use. The buttons allow for controlling playback, adjusting volume, taking calls, and activating voice assistants. The buttons are well-placed and provide good feedback, making it easy to use the controls without needing to look at them. The earphones also support quick switching between two paired devices, a handy feature for those who frequently switch between their phone and laptop.

**Call Quality:**
The Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC features a built-in microphone that provides clear voice transmission during calls. The noise cancellation technology also extends to call quality, effectively reducing background noise so that your voice comes through clearly even in noisy environments. This makes the earphones suitable for professional use, such as conference calls or virtual meetings.

### Additional Features

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC comes with several additional features that enhance the overall user experience:

**Environmental Noise Cancellation (ENC):**
While ANC helps block out external noise during music playback, the Environmental Noise Cancellation (ENC) technology focuses on improving call quality by reducing background noise during calls. This ensures that your voice is heard clearly on the other end, even in noisy environments.

**Magnetic Control:**
The magnetic control feature automatically pauses music playback when the earbuds are snapped together and resumes when they are separated. This not only helps conserve battery life but also adds convenience, especially when you need to quickly pause and resume your music.

**Voice Assistant Support:**
The earphones support voice assistants like Google Assistant and Siri, allowing for hands-free control of your device. This is particularly useful when you need to make a call, send a message, or get directions without reaching for your phone.

### Comfort and Fit

Comfort is a crucial aspect of any in-ear earphones, and the Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC scores well in this department. The earphones come with multiple sizes of silicone ear tips, ensuring a secure and comfortable fit for different ear shapes. The snug fit also helps with passive noise isolation, further enhancing the effectiveness of the ANC feature.

**Weight and Wearability:**
The earphones are lightweight, making them comfortable to wear for extended periods without causing ear fatigue. The neckband design distributes the weight evenly across the shoulders, preventing the earphones from feeling heavy or cumbersome.

**Suitability for Sports and Workouts:**
Thanks to the IP55 rating, the Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is resistant to sweat and water, making them suitable for workouts and outdoor activities. The secure fit ensures that the earphones stay in place during physical activity, providing a reliable audio experience even during intense exercise.

### Price and Value for Money

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is priced competitively, offering excellent value for money given its feature set. It is positioned in the mid-range segment, making it accessible to a wide range of users while still providing premium features such as Hybrid ANC, powerful bass, and long battery life.

**Comparison with Competitors:**
When compared to other wireless earphones in the same price range, the Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC holds its own, if not outperforms, many competitors. The combination of sound quality, build, and features like fast charging and ANC make it a strong contender in the market. Competitors like the Realme Buds Wireless and JBL Tune series offer similar features, but the overall package of the Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is more refined, especially in terms of bass performance and battery life.

**Long-Term Value:**
Considering the durability, battery life, and sound quality, the Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC represents a long-term investment. The earphones are built to last, and the feature set ensures that they will continue to meet your needs even as your usage patterns evolve.

### Conclusion

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is a well-rounded pair of wireless earphones that excels in multiple areas. Whether you're looking for powerful bass, effective noise cancellation, long battery life, or a comfortable fit, these earphones deliver on all fronts. They are particularly well-suited for users who enjoy bass-heavy music genres and need a reliable pair of earphones for daily use.

- **Comfortable and Secure Fit:** Ergonomically designed for extended use, with IP55 rating","I recently purchased your headphone, but I am not satisfied with its performance. The sound clarity is not good while riding a bike, and at times, the sound cuts off automatically. These issues are affecting the overall experience, and I am quite disappointed with the product.

I request you to kindly look into the matter and provide a solution or replacement if possible.

Looking forward to your prompt response.","Good sound quality and durable built. However, the wire connecting earbuds quality is degraded over time - little thinner and less flexible compared to earlier sent same models. May be cost compromised.","The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC deliver solid sound with deep bass and surprisingly good noise cancellation for the price. Very comfortable to wear, and the battery life is amazing — easily lasts over 20 hours with ANC on, and fast charging is a lifesaver.

✅ Pros:

Powerful bass

Good ANC

Definitely recommended if you're on a budget and want solid ANC!","Really nice for the price. Sounds great, the ANC is better than expected and quite comfortable. My only negative may actually be your positive so take it as u want.. there is no off button. The ear pieces stick together with magnets automatically disconnecting the device. While that may sound convenient, if they get separated while stuffing the headset into your bag, your phone may stay connected draining the battery of the headset and making u unable to answer any calls.","OnePlus Bullets Z2 – My Take

**Purchased on:** 29th September 2024

**Pros:**

1. **Impressive Bluetooth Range:** Thanks to Bluetooth 5.3, I experience clear audio with minimal distortion on both my phone and laptop, even when I'm in another room.
2. **Enhanced Audio Quality with AAC Codec:** The inclusion of the AAC codec noticeably improves audio clarity.
3. **Effective Active Noise Cancellation (ANC):** This feature performs exceptionally well, effectively reducing background noise even in crowded spaces like carnivals or the gym.
4. **Clear Microphone Quality:** The mic quality is excellent; I’m consistently heard loud and clear on calls.
5. **Useful Transparency Mode:** Allows you to remain aware of your surroundings—great for safety when biking.
6. **Quick Charge Feature:** Battery reaches full charge in just 15-20 minutes, making it super convenient.
7. **Seamless Device Switching:** The function button quickly swaps between last-paired devices and reconnects automatically.
8. **Google Fast Pair Support:** For easy pairing with compatible devices.
9. **Sturdy Build:** The neckband and cables feel durable, though I'd recommend handling with care.
10. **Secure Fit:** Stays put in the ears without slipping out.

**Cons:**

1. **Frequent Disconnection on Windows:** There's a consistent disconnecting issue when paired with a Windows laptop, which doesn’t happen on other devices. This may not be a concern if it’s used exclusively on the laptop.
2. **Volume Limitation:** Despite the 12.4mm drivers, the sound feels slightly low, requiring a 50%+ volume level.
3. **Occasional Call Connection Issues:** Sometimes, the phone defaults to its own earpiece instead of the neckband during calls.
4. **Battery Life Falls Short:** With ANC, I get about 6-7 hours of playback, and around 15 hours with ANC off, which doesn’t meet the 20-hour claim by OnePlus.
5. **Comfort Issues at First:** The earbuds felt a bit uncomfortable during initial use, but this improved slightly after a month. However, if my ears are moist, they still can feel a bit stingy.
6. **Bass Might Disappoint Bass Lovers:** Bass isn’t as pronounced, though mids and trebles are well-balanced.
7. **No Dual Device Pairing:** Limits multitasking with multiple devices.

While the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is a decent buy under ₹1,800, I wouldn't recommend it at a higher price point. There are other options worth considering if you’re willing to explore!","I recently got my hands on the OnePlus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless Earphones, and I have to say, they’ve made a significant impression on me. Here’s my take on the pros and cons based on my experience.

Pros:
Bombastic Bass: The 12.4 mm drivers deliver incredible bass that really enhances my listening experience. Whether I'm jamming to music or watching movies, the sound quality is truly impressive.

Comfortable Fit: These earphones come with different ear tip sizes, allowing me to find the perfect fit. They sit snugly in my ears, making them comfortable for extended use.

Good Battery Life: I appreciate the battery performance; they last for hours on a single charge, so I can enjoy my music throughout the day without constantly worrying about recharging.

Clear Microphone Quality: The built-in microphone does a great job during calls. I’ve received positive feedback from friends and family about how clear I sound, even in noisy environments.

Fast Charging: The fast charging feature is a lifesaver. A quick charge provides several hours of playback, which is perfect when I’m in a rush.

Cons:
Limited Controls: The controls are somewhat basic. While they allow for play/pause and volume adjustments, I wish they had more options for customizing sound settings directly.

No Active Noise Cancellation: Although the sound quality is great, the absence of active noise cancellation means that background noise can be noticeable, which can be distracting in loud settings.

Wired Design: As a neckband style, the cable can sometimes get in the way during activities, like exercising. I prefer fully wireless options for a more seamless experience.

Build Quality: While they feel decent, I did notice that the build quality could be a bit sturdier. I’m a bit concerned about how they’ll hold up over time with regular use.

Conclusion
Overall, I’m quite satisfied with the OnePlus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless Earphones. The bombastic bass, comfortable fit, and solid battery life make them a great choice for music lovers like me. While there are a few drawbacks, such as limited controls and no active noise cancellation, they don’t detract significantly from the overall experience. If you're looking for affordable earphones that deliver impressive sound quality, I definitely recommend giving these a try!","Phone pass me thaa - Bluetooth connect thaa

B0DFQ1R3W4,4.1,"I’ve been using the OnePlus Nord Buds 3 for a few weeks now, and they’ve exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is excellent, with punchy bass, clear mids, and crisp highs. The 32dB active noise cancellation works surprisingly well, blocking out most ambient noise during commutes and workouts.

One of my favorite features is the fast charging—just 10 minutes gives me around 11 hours of playback, which is perfect when I’m in a rush. On a full charge, I get around 40-43 hours of total playback with the case, which is fantastic for long trips or busy days.

The fit is comfortable and secure, and they don’t fall out even during workouts. Bluetooth connectivity is strong and stable, and pairing with my OnePlus phone was seamless.

Overall, these earbuds offer premium features at a very competitive price. Definitely recommend them if you’re looking for reliable wireless earbuds with solid ANC and excellent battery life!","I am using these earbuds for almost 4-5 days and for almost 6-7 hours so my review is gonna be long. I will tell some pro/cons about these earbuds.

Pros:

1. Their design is awesome as their fit won’t be giving you any discomfort.

2. Build quality is top notch but not very premium so they kinda justify their price point.

3. Bass is very good so audiophiles can relax, treble is also balanced so audio is not drowned in bass, lastly the mid is crisp so the vocals sound loud and clear.

4. Hey Melody app will add lot of value to already value added earbuds, however pro model and non pro models come with different set of features aka their is no transparency mode in non pro models and no on/off feature.

5. Great touch sensitivity as their are no issues to it and they function perfectly.

Cons:

1. Questionable battery life(not bad), these earbuds claim a lot of battery life but that’s not true at all. You will get 5-7 hours with ANC on and if you turn it off then you might get 7-9 hours which is good.

2. ANC is also questionable as its good but not perfect as you can still hear things if it’s turned on. 49db is just marketing gimmick.

3. Delay in audio if connected to 2 devices, if you connect 2 devices then there will be delay in one device, mostly like a lag when you are listening to songs, that goes away when its just one device.

4. Pricing of Pro and Non-Pro model. This one costed me like 2700 and non-pro model is 2000 and it makes no sense as there are just 2 features missing from non-pro model that is on/off and ambient noise so if that’s not important for you go with non-pro model as 700 extra is just a waste as they sound similar, the 32db and 49db ANC is just marketing gimmick as my friend had non-pro model and it sounded similar to mine with ANC.

Conclusion: Go with pro model if you want transparency mode as that’s something I use a lot and if not just buy the non-pro model. These are very good earbuds. They are also the best when it comes to ANC and other features as same features are costing a lot in different brands. Lastly I am attaching 3 EQ presets (Balance, Vocal, Bass) which are better than the default ones as they are up a notch, hopefully it helps others if they want to customise their earbuds sound profile, you can tweak them if you want something extra.

P.S The Cost cutting with packaging is appalling, I got previous nord buds box and its solid cardboard but this one is just filmsy paper box.",These are an amazing pair of tws for the price. I was looking for a secondary tws to my AirPods pros and I had the cmf buds earlier which never worked well at all with many crashes and connectivity issues plus buggy app support with iOS devices. These offer a great experience with decent sound quality robust design and brilliant battery life great bluetooth connectivity and range. Many tws earbuds don’t really work seamlessly with apple devices in general but with the HeyMelody app and dual device connectivity these tws earbuds do a decent job. The mic quality is good aswell I really haven’t tried the anc yet but it is good enough for the price don’t feel like getting a case because the earbuds seem durable. Overall the product is a solid 5🌟 if you are an apple user these would be a nice choice to choose between a galore of options from different brands.,"The OnePlus Nord Buds 3 are a great set of earphones with captivating features for the price. The earphones are powered by 12.4mm drivers, which produce a balanced sound! I have used these buds for over 4-weeks and i have noticed a few things that should be mentioned:
1. Great sound for the price - the buds come with a clear distinguished should between the mids, trebles, and bass. The balanced sound profile that is available in the application (more on that later) is great for most people. Although, I tend to favor the serenade sound profile.
2. BASS - the bass on these tiny devices in excellent!!! It is perfect for any bass lovers and the bass never outshines the mids and trebles. In simple words, if you are a bass lover.... YOU NEED TO BUY THESE.
3. design - This part of the review is subjective, but I found the design refreshing and catchy. This design is unique as compared to the other TWS which tend to copy Apple Airpods and Samsung Galaxy Buds. These try and create a unique look which I prefer over the simple stem design.
4. Touch controls - Here is where the TWS lose one star. When I first paired these to my device, I tried to use the touch controls which just were not working. I tried to inquire about the reason of this inconvenience and found out that you have to download the app and set them yourself. Although it is already recommended to download the app, some people that do not want to download it are forced to just to activate this feature which should be available from the box. Plus, volume control is not present although it would have a good feature.
5. App - The app is phenomenal. It has had no glitches or stutters. It has everything you need such as your case battery, individual earbuds battery, different sound profiles, ANC, all in a simple easy-to-understand UI. This is how every app should be. App name is Hey Melody.
6. ANC - the ANC on these buds is how it should be. Nothing out of the ordinary, it is just average.","Rating: 4.5/5

The battery life is solid—around 5-6 hours on a single charge, plus quick charge features that provide 2 hours of playback with just 10 minutes of charging. Bluetooth connectivity is fast and stable, and the touch controls are easy to use. Plus, they’re water-resistant, making them perfect for active use.

For a great combination of price, performance, and comfort, I highly recommend the OnePlus Nord 3 earbuds. Check them out here: OnePlus Nord 3 Earbuds.","I bought this IEMs for simple purpose i.e Good ANC while listening to music or videos on which this delivers well.
I didn't want to spend a lot on IEMs plus I wanted to see whats the buzz with the mid tier IEMs so got these.
These IEMs block good amount of disturbance from the background while listening to music, I can hear zero to none of the outside noise while traveling in train.
The sound quality is good. The three audio modes in the app are well set. For me the highs and mids are clear and punchy but the lows aren't clear but that's too much to expect for this price range.
The battery life is good. Once fully charged i am able to use it for 3 days. It's used for taking office calls, listening to music and videos while traveling and it meets my requirement here.
I like the case and the buds are also very well built. I do feel an itch while playing it for more than an hour in my ears but I like that weirdly as prolonged usage of IEMs isn't good for our ears.
The controls are very touch sensitive, any bump on your iems gets recognized and your call is dropped, music is paused.
This can be paired with two devices at once and it functions very well.
The call quality is very bad. The sound is very blunt, robotic and unclear when the ANC is on, when it's set to transparent mode then the mic picks up everything around me apart from my voice. So don't go for this if you are looking for good call quality.

I will update my review incase needed.","Review: one plus nord buds 3 Earbuds – A Perfect Blend of Clarity and Comfort

I’ve tried many earbuds, but these stands out for its exceptional balance of sound quality, comfort, and battery life.

Sound Quality (8/10)

The bass is deep but not overpowering, while the mids and highs are crisp and well-defined. Whether I’m listening to classical, pop, or podcasts, the sound remains immersive without distortion, even at high volumes. The active noise cancellation (ANC) works well, blocking out most background noise without feeling unnatural.

Comfort & Fit (8.5/10)

The earbuds fit snugly in my ears without causing discomfort during long listening sessions. They come with multiple ear tips, making it easy to find the perfect fit. However, after a few hours, I did feel a slight pressure in my ears.

Battery Life (9/10)

I was pleasantly surprised by the battery life—around 8 hours per charge, with the case extending it up to 30 hours. Plus, the fast-charging feature gives me an extra 2 hours of playtime in just 10 minutes.

Connectivity & Features (9/10)

Pairing is effortless with Bluetooth 5.3, and the connection remains stable even at a distance. The touch controls are intuitive, allowing me to switch tracks, adjust volume, and take calls without reaching for my phone. The transparency mode is also a nice touch, letting me hear my surroundings when needed.

Verdict: 9/10 – Worth the Price?

At its price point, one plus offers premium features without breaking the bank. If you’re looking for a pair of earbuds with great sound, solid battery life, and reliable ANC, these are a fantastic choice.","The market for wireless earbuds has exploded over the years, but finding a pair that hits the right balance between sound quality, design, noise cancellation, and price can be tricky. Enter the OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro – a product that promises high-end features at an accessible price point. After testing these buds thoroughly, here’s my in-depth review.

1. Design and Build Quality:

Right out of the box, the OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro scream minimalism and sophistication. The black matte finish feels premium, with the sleek design of the buds fitting snugly in the ear. They’re ergonomically designed, making them comfortable even during extended use. At just 4.9 grams per bud, they’re lightweight, ensuring no discomfort even after hours of listening.

The charging case follows the same minimalist aesthetic, with a compact form factor that easily slips into your pocket. The magnetic closure adds a satisfying snap when you put the earbuds back, and the overall build quality is top-notch for the price.

2. Sound Quality:

Sound is where the OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro truly shine. Equipped with 12.4mm dynamic drivers, the audio performance is surprisingly rich. The bass is deep but well-balanced, never overpowering the mids or highs. Whether I was listening to bass-heavy tracks or acoustic music, the sound remained clear and full-bodied.

The clarity across frequencies is impressive, making these earbuds suitable for a variety of genres. The sound profile is natural, with no excessive boosting of any frequency, which is often a downfall in budget earbuds. If you’re someone who enjoys a balanced audio experience with a touch of warmth in the low end, these are perfect.

3. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC):

One of the standout features is the up to 49dB Active Noise Cancellation. This level of ANC is rare to find in earbuds at this price point. Whether you’re in a noisy coffee shop, commuting, or on a plane, the ANC effectively filters out background noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience.

However, the noise cancellation isn’t the absolute best in the market, but for the price, it works extremely well. It blocks out the majority of low-frequency sounds, though you might still hear some very high-pitched noises. The transparency mode also works well, letting in ambient sound when needed, without making it sound unnatural or muffled.

4. Call Quality:

Call quality is often a hit or miss with wireless earbuds, but OnePlus has done a commendable job here. During calls, the Nord Buds 3 Pro performed admirably, providing clear and crisp voice quality on both ends. The ENC (Environmental Noise Cancellation) works well, especially in noisy environments, ensuring that your voice cuts through clearly.

Whether I was on a busy street or in a quiet room, the other person could hear me without any issues. The four microphones integrated into the earbuds focus on picking up your voice while minimizing background noise, which is impressive for earbuds in this price range.

5. Battery Life:

Battery life is another strong point. With ANC turned off, you can get up to 44 hours of playback including the charge from the case. Even with ANC enabled, the buds offer around 9 hours on a single charge and about 33 hours total with the charging case, which is more than sufficient for most users.

The fast charging feature is a game-changer – just 10 minutes of charge gives you up to 11 hours of playback, making them ideal for users who are constantly on the move.

6. Connectivity:

The Bluetooth 5.3 technology ensures a stable and fast connection with almost zero dropouts. Pairing is seamless, especially with OnePlus devices, but even with other Android and iOS devices, the connection is swift and consistent.

The low-latency mode is perfect for gamers, offering minimal audio delay, which is crucial during fast-paced gameplay. I experienced no issues with connectivity, even when moving between rooms or keeping my phone in my pocket.

7. Additional Features and Functionality:

The OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro come with IP55 water and dust resistance, which makes them a reliable companion for workouts and outdoor activities. Whether you’re running in the rain or sweating it out at the gym, these earbuds can handle it without any issues.

The touch controls are responsive and allow you to easily manage playback, calls, and ANC modes without needing to take out your phone. You can also customize the touch controls through the HeyMelody app, available on both Android and iOS, giving you more control over your listening experience.

8. Pros and Cons:

Pros:

• Balanced Sound Quality with rich bass and clear mids and highs
• 49dB ANC – excellent for this price range
• Lightweight and comfortable design for long-term use
• Long battery life with up to 44 hours with the case
• Fast charging (10 mins for 11 hours of playback)
• IP55 rating for water and dust resistance
• Stable connectivity with Bluetooth 5.3 and low-latency gaming mode

Cons:

• ANC, while good, may not match the premium models
• No wireless charging option for the case
• Touch controls can sometimes be a bit too sensitive

Final Verdict:

The OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro are a fantastic pair of truly wireless earbuds that offer a near-flagship experience at a mid-range price. From the balanced sound and impressive ANC to the comfortable design and excellent battery life, they deliver on all fronts. The call quality is exceptional, and the fast charging feature is perfect for those always on the go.

While there are a few minor drawbacks, such as the lack of wireless charging and ANC that could be improved, these are small compromises considering the price point. Whether you’re a casual listener, a gamer, or someone who needs a reliable pair of buds for daily use, the OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro are an excellent choice. They’re packed with features typically found in much pricier models, making them a great value for money.

In a single earbud, the noise cancellation is not as effective. Also, the first time I wore them, I felt slight pain in my ear. I feel like wearing them continuously should be avoided for ear safety.","Sound quality and anc for best earbuds looks, builds quality design and durability overall is best. good battery back up and fast charging support",I have updated oneplus nord buds 2 to this buds 3 pro. Nothing changed except design. Everything Same. Don't waste ur money if u already have oneplus buds,This product is very good and sound quality are excellent 😌❤️,"Using it for past 1month. Decent audio, good design. Fits ear well. Connectivity is good.

Can buy.","product was quite good, good enough with anc of 32d, experience of ear buds are excellent, well base not irritated, ballanced vocal with crystal voice, but the draw back is its was quite irritated while keeping long time of ear pods in ear, hold of ear buds are good,battery back is not much as good as in reality, packing of product was great",This product is best and also have best anc and audio quality,"Really good sound - With one plus device this is the best one under Rs.2000/-
Base, trible, vocal everything is balanced. For Rs.2000/- go for it blindly.",Cute. Vfm. Decent amount of noise cancellation. Not completely. Love the green and steel blue. I use it for Zoom sessions. I do not use the mic on it though. Zoom allows for separate mic input so i use the laptop one which is better (Xiaomi). Battery life is good. Charges quickly too in the phone fast charger or laptop charger. Very happy with this purchase.,Extream product 😃,Worth for 1999,"The sound quality is very good, it feels free in the ear, and very worth it in this price quality is very good.","The anc works pretty good, very noticeable especially on noisy roads—not the best, but no complains in this price point. Sound is clear, no boosted frequencies too much.. sounds pleasant. I’m cutting one star off because the one-tap-pause feature won’t work 90% of the times. If I tap twice, it goes to the next track, if I tap three times, it’ll go to the previous track, if I long press, it will turn anc on and off.. but when it’s time to pause, it’ll do nothing most of the times! I have to take my phone out and then pause.",The product quality was great .,Not bad,The product is good but the packaging was slightly damaged outwise the product is good the sound of the buds are clear,"Very nice earbuds, voice quality is also good, ANC also works good. Only thing is app is not upto the mark , very little options to customise",Everything super but connectivity is slow,Nice,"The OnePlus Buds Pro 3 deliver amazing sound quality with deep bass and clear vocals. The active noise cancellation works perfectly, blocking out most background noise. Battery life is excellent, and the fit is comfortable for long hours. A great choice for music lovers and calls!","I'm a college student and no doubt the product has already exceeded my expectations, honestly the battery last very well , the case is sturdy and made of premium material . The 49db ANC. Cancels out everything in the surrounding , its amazing that I'm sitting in my mess with 150 other students talking + ducting noise and the ANC just cancels every noise, it helps alot. The sound quality, punchy bass , in ear detection 10/10.
I gave it 4 star only because the headphone charging pins are at the bottom of box , which makes it risky in future if the pins get loose.","1. Design - look premium but in hand feel like plastic & spacialy it's light weight & comfortable in one hand use with flip, overall very good at this price point. my Rating 4.5/5
2. connectivity - it hase blootooth 5.4 support latest so it helps good connection & use of law battery, it's support dual pairing but some catch (still i hasn't use this feature) many says when it connect with 2nd device the 1st device audio will continue through speaker spacialy in laptop use, my Rating 4/5
3. Battery life - battery life is excellent just because of loudness you never use at maximum volume which also helps to use long, claimed battery life is 11hrs without ANC, but I get almost 11hrs plus battery without ANC at 40 -50% volume at night during watching continues series & with ANC I got about 7 hrs at volume level of 50% because it's very loud, my previous oppo enco air 2 pro is not so loud so I use that at 80% of volume. my Rating 4.5/5
4. Feature - it support 49db ANC which is excellent at this price point comper to any other tws and you can also costemize it, it's almost reduce maximum background noise, transperancy mod is also good, it hase bass wave feature for extra bass, it's support google fast pair, in ear detection, & HD AAC & Dolby Atmos support, but not support any ldac or lhdc. my Rating 4/5
5. Audio quality - This is most important because I shift from oppo enco air 2 pro, you never comper it with my previous oppo buds, oppo best in sound quality, yes if you love bass then it is perfect for you, in detail you will find every best, Clear vocals, separate instrument, good treble everything good but in and it's not delivered perfect final sound in the end, yes you can costemize it from Equalizer which I made & now I m happy with its sound just like my previous oppo air 2 pro not same but almost 95% perfect, my costemized Equalizer setting is -1,0,1,2,1,0,0 & BASSWAVE AT 2nd LEVEL and I use it on Movie Mode in Dolby Atmos which give good sorrund effect with loud clean vocal, i also add pic of my Equalizer setting I use OnePlus phone, My Rating 4/5
CONCLUSION - if you get it below 3000rs around 2700 then it is totally value for money just go for it, you can costemize sound as per your choice I add my settings also if you like, I get it at 2399 in sale, My Overall Rating is 4/5 because I think they can tune it very well, even you will get ear pain after use but after few days you will use to it",Product is good. I m using this with nord 4. Not able to pair with another mobile of realme. Sound quality and bass is good.,Nive,The bass is nice and ability to transform from transparency to noise cancellation feature is awesome.,good,"I bought this buds 20 days ago. Now I am sharing my experience, This buds is awesome for music listening and bass is much higher and better than expected. But the problem I am facing is fitting in ear. Bluetooth connectivity is good. And for gaming purpose it's okay okay you can play with slightly delay in latency. Touch controls are good. Only feeling fitting problem in my ears . Otherwise it's best to invest money. Hope it's helpful",ANC feature is amazing!!Sound effects are good too!!The design is sleek and easy to carry around in pockets and small purses!!Good product for this price!!Battery life is good too!!Worthy purchase!!,"I am a crazy fan of one plus ear gadgets, recently purchased one plus nord earbuds pro but was disappointed.

When you are using the earbuds in noise cancellation/transparency mode, simultaneously you use a mosquito racket. The earbuds absords the electric buzzing from the bat and transmits directly into your ears causing inconvenience.

I am not sure if this is common with all ear gadgets having noise cancellation/transparency features.

I had checked for the same issue with 2 different same new devices. The output was same.

Other than this ,this earbuds is a solid 10/10 for this particular cost range.

I would love if Oneplus identifies and rectifies the issue.",Sound is great but at the time of calling everytime need to press volume key to increase voice. Need to be fix,Good one but poor battery life,"If you want perfect tws under 2000 just go for it
The bass is good
Trubel is fantastic
Sound sepretion is good
Fit like ok ok
Connectivity is good
Big thumps up for battery pafomence
Thank OnePlus and Amazon for this amazing product ❤️",Good sound quality,"Used it extensively for the last one month.
1. Good battery backup.
2. Good for calls only if your background noise is very low. If you have cooker, utensils making noise closeby then other side person CANNOT HEAR you as noise cancellation is VERY BAD. I have Nothing earbuds whose battery of one bud has gone bad. That Nothings noise cancellation is lot better under same conditions but then it's price is almost double.
3. Music etc is fine.",Excellent sound quality and Smooth style 🤩✌,"Audio quality is good. But, the build quality is not 100% good. The rubber in the bud is tooo thin that it comes of very often. Other than that i feel its good for regular use.","Everything was going well, the features were good, the look was good but when I was playing music I was able to pause the music but I couldn't play it.
I checked every feature and all were working but the main and basic feature was not working 😕",Very good,Bass quality is superb .. if you re looking for bass then go for it,Just got it with a hiccup of play and pause not working on the single tap tried everything including firmware update but then google helped me with Heymelody app which should there is no function mentioned on single tap so after changing its working fine as of now . Let's hope it keeps going the same way 😅,"Product is good and sound effect and futures are good .
Controls are easy to use and sound clarity is very good.
Worth for the money","Today i received this product. It is awesome and main thing it is comfortable to wear, specially i wore oneplus buds 2r and 2 long tine ago and i loved the fit of it also by trutjng on buds 3 pro it also fits very nicely. The anc is damn too good. Also the app support ( Hey Melody) has various features where other brands dont have. I am very satisfied with the brand and personally love this brand. At this price point I would recommend all of you to buy this awesome tws Nord buds 3 pro.",Im happy with the product. It works just as advertised. & Its affordable.,"EASY TO HANDLE ,
NICE PRODUCT",Still need to improve!!,Good color combination and sound quality,Great product,"Ok, not very good","Iam using one plus z2 neckband for 2 yrs now this . The audio was quiet upgrade. There is no ear pain compare to nechband. Quality also very good . Bass 🙌🙌. This is a best upgrade.

However if you use for an hour, your ears will pain. Not sure why?",Well all the features of this earphones is great but there might be a glitch which i guess OnePlus will remove it in an update of theirs while switching from one app to another it generally doesn't give me the audio for quite a few seconds and also in the dual pairing mode it doesn't work well as well apart from every feature of this works well,"After 6 months review, hard on ears tried all sizes, microphone is ordinary, even at home need to keep mobile close, fails to catch voice. One more peculier problem is that doesn't get connected easily to laptop, sometimes need a reset or restart of laptop.
Battery is okay for a mild user.
Not recommended.","Using it for quite a few months! Audio on call comes with a background noise, which is annoying. Charging and touch are decent. Noise cancellation is good, that is why the extra stars.",I got the best deal for sure I have purchased it for 2k and the product is damm good yeah but some extreme music lovers who have deliema of ANC so it's not too good it's decent but other features are so good under this price range.,Very nice ear buds just lovely!! I love the sound quality and specially i love the noise cancellation part it is super duper!! Highly recommend please go ahead with this ear buds. I am very happy customer! Thank youuu ONEPLUS and thank youuu AMAZON!!!,They sound good ANC is also good but the realme buds 6 have better anc but if you have a OnePlus or oppo then this is better for faster connectivity and they sound better on OnePlus and oppo devices overall good,"All good except battery life. My boult audio buds were more effective in terms of battery capacity of the case.
This docker case supports only twice full charge.",Product was good quality and anc was works good in this price range,"use best and light weight ,good design,nice connectivity ,","Overall Rating: (9.625/10)

Here's a breakdown of the product in it's most prevalent features.
1. ANC - (10/10)
Arguable one of the best ANCs I have experienced. I have used this in 3 different scenarios and it performed incredibly well.
a. Road Travel: Heavy Traffic, lot of noise. This cancels 70% of it without music, and 90% of it with music.
b. Irritating Noise: It cancels out the noise made from keyboards typing, specifically mechanical blue switch keyboards, which are known to be the most annoying of all. In an enclosed room with barely 2 meters of distance and no other noise, these earphones nullifies the constant THOCCC sounds that comes while my neighbor is typing on their keyboard, even when they are purposefully hitting the keys with maximum force.
c. Concerts: This did incredibly well when I traveled and went to concerts and was placed very near to the speaker. Of course it cancelled about 30% of the loudness but I could still hear it, but this alone should be a testament to how well these handle noise.

2. Audio Quality - (8.5/10)
You could in theory get the Sony's earphone range and get better audio but that's not the point. This is close to a 9/10 when you properly EQ the earphones. It's pretty bass heavy, but it doesn't sound muddled, the high tones and mid tones are also heard with much clarity.
Since I am not much of an audiophile, I cannot give you a very well-informed opinion, however if you're the average listener like me, I will recommend this very much to you.

3. App Support: HeyMelody by OnePlus - (10/10)
Don't trust the Google Play Store reviews for this App, it might have been lowered during the initial development of the app, but ever since then, the App does as it is advertised. It allows you to:
a. Do multi-device connection (which works excellently by the way)
b. EQ
c. Change between Noise Cancelling, Off & Transparency modes.

4. Build Quality - (10/10)
a. Case: Made out of a metal I believe, very lightweight.
b. Earphones: Eartips are great, very soft and comfortable during long duration. The earbuds themselves are made out of probably plastic, very very lightweight and barely noticable.","Battery life is not up to the mark. It lasts hardly for one day but the company claims 44hs battery backup which is not even close to actual battery life. Otherwise the product is fantastic good design sound quality, fit and finish all is good. 👍

Giving review after 1.5months usage.",Best in this price segment,Good product,Best earbuds at this price range and has good noise cancellation and good battery life as well .i like it's design .I am using this for nearly for 4 months,"Mast performance, if you have 3000 in your budget then close your eyes and go for it,
Bass quality top
Music top
Call quality wanderful

I am very impressed",Nice product 👌.voice quality is very good,"I've been using these earbuds for a month now, so here’s what I’ve found to be good and bad.

The Good:

Active Noise Cancellation works well.

Sound quality is solid—bass and treble sound great (coming from someone who edits videos professionally).

The mic quality is good; no one I’ve talked to has had any complaints about my voice quality.

Connectivity is reliable; it connects almost instantly (I’m using a OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite, so I can’t say for other models).

The buttons on the buds are customizable and work just fine.

I was initially worried they might fall out since I’ve never used buds before, but so far, no issues with that.

Battery life is good for me. I don’t use them all the time, but mostly for listening to music while working or for long calls. With this usage (2–3 hours daily), I only need to charge them once every 4 or 5 days.

The Bad:

This might just be me, but I feel like my ear canals are on the smaller side. Even with the smallest ear tips, I can’t wear them for too long—after about half an hour, my ears start to hurt, and I have to adjust or take them out. This can get pretty annoying.

The case’s build quality is great overall, and the buds stay secure, even if you shake it. But the hinge on the lid feels a bit loose where it connects to the lower part, making the cap feel a bit wobbly, which isn’t ideal.

Overall:
These are my thoughts after a month of use, and I hope it gives you a better idea of whether or not to buy them.","Those who not have OnePlus 10 series smartphone or above, and have other brand smartphone this OnePlus Nord buds 3 pro earbuds not for them... Because this earbuds full potential shown when it's connect to OnePlus devices ok... So who don't know that plz don't misguide others who have OnePlus smartphone...","Pros:
✅ Stylish and lovely design
✅ Good overall performance
✅ Excellent touch controls
✅ High-quality build
✅ Well-packaged
✅ Strong connectivity

Cons:
❌ In-ear fitting needs improvement
❌ Battery life is just okay

Suggestion:

Improve the earbud fitting for better comfort and security.
Enhance battery life for longer usage.","It's a very good product, I like the quality and material. Functionality is great . Good for gaming, charging is also great . Size is compact and good.","The OnePlus Nord Buds 3 is very good pair of buds for the budget. If you want a reasonably priced TWS, go for this.
It doesn’t pause and play when you take off or put on the buds, it will keep playing anything till you put them on the case.
In iPhone or non OP phones, you need to install HeyMelody app to adjust the settings. Personally, I don’t like the fit, sometimes it feels hard to speak over a call. May be I cant hear myself better while speaking. Just telling I did use OP Buds Z2, it was way better than this.
The OP Nord Buds 3 keeps the charge for a long time, never had the fuss to keep them charged frequently.
The audio is okay, not the best, the default EQ settings is bad. You need to use Bass Boost to listen to Rock or EDM or Pop.
But in the low budget, this gives more for the buck.",Very uncomfortable to keep it for long time. It's hurt the ears,"Well built and it stays in my ear without hurting or falling. Sound quality is great. The tap works fine for double tap and triple taps, facing an issue with single tap. All in all i am satisfied with the purchase.","Good sound quality, but myt ear hurt after ssome time","I don’t think this lacks anything for the price tag it comes for. Great design, light weight, great sound quality. ANC is okayish but what do you expect from 2k? Battery life is massive. App is also pretty solid.","ANC is just fabulous, and sound is not that good but yes worth of money","I used OnePlus Nord buds 1 more than 2 years and now I'm upgraded to Nord buds 3 pro and my experience is good...base is improved very much and vocals, trebles are also great... calling is excellent....I also have oppo enco buds 2 and realme wireless 3 pro...but these are great in clarity but base wise still oppo enco buds 2 is slightly better...but the instrument separation is more good than enco buds 2...fully satisfied for its price...Anc in high mode is great..but I won't use that much high and...for me low anc with 60 percent volume is enough....battery backup also top notch 7-8 hours without anc for sure...just gor for it guys❤️","It came in great condition and the delivery was on time thanks to Amazon . Now for the product 😃 I think its perfect for that price tag the sound quality is AWESOME an the ANC feature even in medium level its perfect almost eliminates all surrounding noises. The build quality is fine even for plastic build and charges really fast in about ten to twelve minutes. It comes with bluetooth 5.4 and obviously its really fast while pairing even with some older devices which comes with older versons (mine's 4.2 yet there was no lagging issue or anything and also it's no Oneplus phone keep that in mind) , it's another feature the IP55 protection from sweat and dust is good for it's longevity and the battery is also enough for normal users like me. Overall performance wise its 9/10 for me considering the budget A VALUE FOR MONEY INDEED 👌 Those who are looking for mid budget buds I would 100% reccomend it for them GO FOR IT.","I bought it mainly for call quality and it's doing better, also sound quality is good too","Battery Life is Very Good but the ANC is average, The main issue is the sound quality, it's muddy with too much base, my OPPO enco buds 2 was better at sound quality",The ANC is comparable with more expensive TWS.

Extended use may cause a little bit of heating as in my personal case but other than that, the phone charges in about an hour from 0 to 100 and the backup lasts for a day and a half. Only thing i would change in this phone is a little heating issue. Go for it under 20k.","Really very good, I have purchased it to my dad. Very light weight, battery stays long, camera is really outstanding. I have checked all other phone in this price no phone can beat this. I loved it. After a week I purchased it for myself also.","Amazing smartphone It has almost all the features what a smartphone user needed. 1.Battery capacity is 5500 mah but the backup is not that good. 1.5 day used fully discharged and 5G Used fast drained , 44 wats charger 100% in one hour 2. Amoled Display super and brightness is good, 3. Front and back Camera is good, 4. lite weight compare to others smart phones 5.Ring tone and call speaker sound is excellent 6. finger print sensor is good 7. design super.","All Rounder Phone with good camera
Decent Battery Back-up
It could have better with gorilla glass protection & flat screen

(Please Provide Customers with 2 option Flat Sceeen & Curved Screen)

Everything else is superb in this price range i usually don't write any review but for this product in wanted to write !

😃 Buy it you won't regret","This is my first iqoo device and i must say its amazing. There are more pros in device than cons and I must say no other phone can beat this in this particular price segment.
Design and Build (9/10)-
The phone feels quite sleek and comfortable in hand. Weighing just about 180g and about 7.5mm thick. This phone is by far the slimmest and lightest 5500Mah phone I have ever seen. Even slimmer and slighter than many 5000Mah phone is the market. Ther design language is taken from newly launched Vivo v40 series and this phone is exact replica or little toned down version of Vivo V40e. So you are getting a 28k V40e phone under 20k. A sweet deal right.

Display(8.5/10) -- The display is a typical 120Hz, Oled panel with deep black and around 1000 nits of peak brightness which is more than enough in outdoor environment. Colours are punchy and crisp. You get different colour modes which you can set as per your taste.

Camera (9/10)- Camera is just outstanding. I have never seen such an amazing low light performance from any 15-20k phones in the recent times. The camera balances light very well and even in backlite situation the photos are amazing. The 2x potraits are awesome coupled with various background bokeh modes. Colours are good and dynamic range is fantastic. This phone is camera beast in 18k and I must say Well done Iqoo. They focused on giving 1 very good camera rather than two or three average cameras. Many brands give useless 8MP wide angle camera and mediocre primary camera in this range. If wide angle is your priority than you can go with Iqoo z9s pro model.

Performance(9/10)--
This phone can handle days to day task very smoothly with no zitter or lag. Games run smoothly and 60 fps constant in BGMI.
Not much cpu throttling or heating issue seen so far. This phone has antutu of around 700k which is very good for mid rangers under 20k.

Battery (10/10)--
Battery is just another major USP of this phone. I don't know how they were able to provide such high quality 5500mah battery in such a slim and lightweight phone. The battery backup in normal usage with 120Hz and 5g enable is around 12 Hours(SOT) and if you disable 120Hz and use Wifi the SOT can reach as high as 16Hours(Look at the screenshot). Mind blowing right?. I too was shocked when I used this phone full 2 days with sot of 16 hours. For gamers this can last about 7-8 hours of continuous gaming and for casual users like me easily 1.5 to 2 days on wifi and 1.5 days on 5g. No heating issues while charging and time taken for full charge is 1hour with 45W vivo flash charger.

Software and other features (7/10)--
The funtouch os 14 though very feature rich is not regarded among the top skins in android world but I must say funtouch has been improving a lot in past 3-4 years and is slowly adopting to stock android looks. The main issue which I faced is animation are not very smooth and UI elements lack a consistency in design language (edit-After funtouch OS15 ui is very smooth and animation are silky smooth now). Sometimes minimising an app shows double animation. Btw I have not faced any hanging issue in this phone. Bloatware are present and many can't be disabled as well like vstore,vivo browser jovi home etc. color os or realme os atleast allow user to disable such bloatwares. Vivo should introduce origin os in India as well. Widgets are very poor and there is no option of big app folders as well(after android 15 feature is added)

Speakers, Haptics and connectivity-
Speakers are stereo and quite loud. Not louder than many realme or moto phones but when increasing the volume boost upto 300 percent the sound is indeed very loud though bass is less.
Haptics are not x axis linear 4d motor which you see in many midrange and flagship these days but normal Ghurr Ghurr type vibration motor. Connectivity is very good no issues with 4g or 5g. Even VoNR is supported in this phone.

Overall it is a very good phone under 20k. Hope all the software optimisations like animation, icons and widgets get polished in funtouch os 15.

Update- After funtouch os 15 update animation is now more smoother than before and new widgets are also added.","So if u want best phone under this range of price this is the best choice. Camera quality is best . I am using this phone since 4 months, their is no any bug or problem related phone this has best camera quality i enjoy taking pictures with it battery is fast chargeable and phone is very smooth and fast for usages. It has best processor very speed their no any heating issue connectivity is quite fast.
Their are 2 drawbacks of this phone that
१. It doesn't have audio jack
२. No ultra wide angle cam","After a long wait, finally I get the oynx green z9s. This is just my first day review, I will update it after a week of usage and then again after one or two months as long term. Now, as a first day usage, I am overall satisfied with the device. Below I am dividing the pros and cons of the phone as per my observation.

Pros:
1. The screen is really good and vibrant, so people will like the big colourful screen for sure.
2. The app animations and other transitions are really smooth.
3. The aura light feature, though feels more like a gimmick, it's a cute touch of added feature, I kind of like it while it lights up with the orange whitish colour.
4. I am happy with the update speed, I mean right after the phone is set up, I got latest security updates of October, whereas many costlier devices couldnot provide a timely update.
5. The sound is also good as per price and the sound boost option does help in noisy conditions.
6. The design is really sleek, even with 5500mah battery, it feels so light to hold, the curved displays in both sides make it even slimmer to hold.

Cons:
1. The 120hz refresh is not optimized fully, I feel like that, I mean in many apps, it's not that smooth, I felt some jitter while scrolling fb, YouTube.
2. I saw frame drops a lot while playing 4k HDR videos in YouTube and 2 to 4 times the app even shuts down on its own.
3. If you are not a person, who likes to tinker around the settings, then you will be disturbed a lot with many notifications. I myself have to manually turned off so many notifications and permissions.
4. Yes, I know the processor is not that powerful, so I request you not to deal with more than 4 apps at a time, basically do it little slowly, otherwise you will feel some lag.
5. The call quality is very average, I mean the sound is very low, even in speaker mood, it feels like a normal call sound.

Now, coming to battery life and camera, this, I have not tested yet, so won't comment now, but from 100 to 69%, as of now I am getting 3.30 hrs of SOT, so let's see, I will update after first complete discharge.

This is regarding the battery back up, from 100% to 15%, I got around 10hrs of SOT, without playing games, mostly used fb, insta and lots of HDR and non HDR videos on YouTube, everything with 120hz on. This is after first time charging, now I am mainting 95-30% charging cycle, with this I will update after 1month. Photos are coming soon.

After one month update, I am still getting close to 7.30 to 8 hours of SOT, it hardly heats up, the only thing I encounter is, sometimes it feels laggy, this is probably due to ufs 2.2, rest everything is fine.

After the Android 15 based funtouch os 15 update, I am getting around 10.30 hrs of SOT, with variable screen refresh rate. This is not continuous test, rather, it's my normal day to day usage with 6 hours of sleep time at night. Animations are a bit smoother than previous versions.

The 8hrs 54 minutes screen on time (SOT) is after Android 15 update and 65% on 5g network and 35% on wifi. Jan 3, 2025.",Good phone value of money.,Good mobile,Very very smart phone so like it IQ z9s Mobail,"Ek khwahish thi ye curve display mobile lene ki...

After all that (15hrs of uses), the battery just drained to 25%, which is really good...

B0D2R2MXXJ,4.4,"The Samsung 25W USB-C Super Fast Charger is a must-have for anyone looking for a reliable and efficient charging solution. With Super Fast Charging (SFC) 2.0 support, it quickly charges my Samsung S24+

Pros:
Fast Charging: Charges my Samsung Galaxy S24+ from 0 to 70% in around 30 minutes.
Compact & Lightweight: Easy to carry, making it great for travel.
Universal USB-C Support: Works with other USB-C devices like tablets and even some laptops.

Cons:
Cable Not Included: You need to purchase a separate USB-C to USB-C cable if you don't have one","The charger is excellent and supports 25W fast charging, which is impressive. It charges my 6000mAh phone battery from 0 to 100% in about 1 hour and 30 minutes. The charger doesn’t heat up while in use, is lightweight, and works perfectly with my Samsung smartphone. The quality is good, and I like the simple design. I chose the white color because it matches the cable, but the charger isn’t wrapped in plastic, so it might get dirty or look dull over time.

However, the packaging could be improved, and the price feels a bit high. I also request Samsung to include chargers with budget phones or lower the price to make it more affordable.","original & geniune product from Amazon.

B0DCNWN8NZ,4.2,"Pros:

✅ Classic Apple comfort and design
✅ Clear and balanced sound quality
✅ Reliable microphone for calls
✅ Plug-and-play with USB-C devices
✅ No need for charging

Cons:

❌ No noise isolation compared to in-ear options
❌ Lacks deep bass for bass-heavy music lovers
❌ Not compatible with devices lacking USB-C audio support

Final Verdict:

If you prefer wired earphones over wireless and want a simple, high-quality option for USB-C devices, the Apple EarPods are a fantastic choice. They offer reliability, comfort, and excellent sound without the hassle of charging or Bluetooth pairing. Definitely worth it!","Apple EarPods have truly transformed the way I experience music, offering a blend of comfort and high-quality audio. My thoughts :

1. Exceptional Soundstage

The soundstage on these EarPods is remarkable. They bring every layer of the music to life, allowing you to hear intricate details in songs that were previously unnoticed. From subtle background instruments to dynamic transitions, it feels like being in the middle of a live performance.

2. Comfortable Design

The fit is just right—not too tight, making them comfortable for extended use. They sit snugly in the ears without causing discomfort, but they're not ideal for use in very noisy environments, as they don’t block out external sounds completely. While they may not be perfect for noisy settings, they excel in most other areas, making them an excellent choice for music lovers.

3. Lossless Audio Output

The lossless audio output is a standout feature, delivering crisp, clear, and distortion-free sound. Whether you're listening to soft acoustics or bass-heavy tracks, the EarPods maintain excellent sound fidelity.

4. Build Quality

The EarPods have a sleek design, but the thin wires feel fragile, leaving me unsure about long-term durability. However, I trust Apple’s quality and handle them with care to ensure they last.","Product in terms of perfromance is good, but slightly unfit with the design. I purchased this because of the its design, but its quite unfit in the ear.","Awesome product & sound quality from Apple - Type C Earphone
Music beats super clear, but sound output is bit lower when compared to other earphones, you need to keep phone volume on bit higher side
Calling - Mic & Audio quality is just superb, crystal clear
Earphone design is greater and does not hurt even after long time usage
Wire quality seems bit delicate for the price, so handle with care
Overall great product & you will get premium feel with wired earphones","Apple EarPods (USB-C) – Pure, Lossless Audio!

I’ve used multiple Bluetooth earbuds including premium ones but these EarPods (USB-C) sound way better. The moment I plugged them in, I could hear details in songs I never noticed before.

🔊 Sound Quality – No Compression, Just Pure Audio

Unlike wireless earbuds that compress sound, these deliver clear, detailed and lossless audio. The bass is tight and punchy, vocals sound natural and instrument separation is amazing. If you listen to Apple Music Lossless, these will surprise you.

🎧 Comfort & Fit

Classic Apple fit—lightweight, no pressure on ears and perfect for long sessions. No in-ear seal means they don’t trap heat and you can still hear your surroundings.

📞 Call Quality – Clear & Natural, It beats even AirPods Pro 2nd gen.

The mic is top-notch, much better than most wireless earbuds. Calls sound clear, loud and natural, making them perfect for meetings and calls.

🔋 No Charging, No Latency, No Hassle

✅ Zero delay in audio – great for movies and gaming.
✅ No need to charge – just plug in and enjoy.
❌ Average cable & durable USB-C connector – built to last, however need to use carefully.

❌ A Few Things to Consider
• No noise cancellation – since they’re not in-ear.
• Not for bass heads – bass is clean but not overpowering.

🔥 Final Verdict – Just Buy Them!

For the price, nothing beats these in sound clarity, call quality and ease of use. If you care about pure audio, lossless quality and a reliable mic, just go for it.
Highly recommended!","It's one of best quality earphones I must say. More better than JBL .
Soft and balanced sound, bass is good. I have Google pixel 6a, well connected with type C

Build quality may have been better.",Item is fine but package was really bad even though the manufacturing is from Jan-2025,"Just purchased earpod usb c . Music quality is good. Bass is decent not too deep not too low. Vocals are clear. No noise cancellation. Wire is very thin. I was expecting a thick wire in this price. While playing games like PUBG, BGMI foot sounds are barely heard. I mean I have to increase the volume upto 80% to hear clear footsteps even footsteps of myself.
Fitting in ear is average.

Conclusion:
Sound Quality :⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Bass :⭐⭐⭐⭐
Treble :⭐⭐⭐⭐
Mic :⭐⭐⭐⭐
Build Quality : ⭐⭐
Fit in ear : ⭐⭐⭐","Absolutely amazing,I have never been able to listen to sounds this nicely.If you can buy it, you should 🔥🤩🤩","Decent for gaming
Excellent for calling and media consumption",Good product.,This is realy nice produced and nice packing.. This product is valuable money..👌👌👌,"Product is really good in terms of quality, sound and the design as well.","It was good at 80% of the volume and call quality experience was too good , one major fault is wire quality is too bad..",Nice product got With seal 😄,"They are probably the best earpods out there at this price point but they lack comfort due to the universal fit design, and to compensate that I had to invest in good quality “silicone tips for earpods”.

These are compatible with most of the devices that support type C audio devices.

Keep in mind that you should and must clean the earpods at least every month and also keep your ears clean else the earwax will mess up the buds, to clean the buds just YouTube “how to clean earpods by Chris Notap”.

Also for the enhanced durability apple should switch to braided cable for the earpods as well.","For those who understand how to use them, Apple's wired EarPods deliver an exceptional listening experience. I use them with both a Windows laptop (USB-C) and a Pixel 6 Android phone, and the results are consistently impressive.

On Windows, enabling spatial sound is crucial. Before buying check If your laptop has built-in spatial audio. If spatial audio is there and working fine then you can also consider getting Dolby app from the Windows store if you have budget. I am using with Windows 11 and spatial audio turned on without Dolby app. My basic laptop, when paired with Windows Spatial Sound, transformed my music. I discovered previously unheard details in familiar tracks, revitalizing even my most overplayed favorites.

To further enhance the audio, I strongly suggest an Apple Music subscription, even on Android. While I've used Spotify Premium and YouTube Music Premium, Apple Music's sound quality, especially when set to the highest audio quality (though data-intensive), surpasses them. Surprisingly, the improvement extended to my car's audio system via Android Auto.

For improved comfort and a secure fit, consider purchasing silicon covers for the EarPods. This prevents them from falling out and enhances overall comfort.

The ergonomic design fits comfortably in my ears without causing any discomfort, even during long listening sessions. Unlike regular in-ear buds, these don't feel intrusive yet provide a great seal for excellent sound isolation. The built-in mic is also crystal clear for calls.

It's been 10-15 days, No ANC and as mentioned it supports complete ENC where user on other side will not at all listen anything when in call.

Pros:
1) best sound with good bass
2) compact and Good design of case
3) dual device connectivity.

Cons:
1) user on other side will not at all listen to us.
2) buds will get drop of when turn our head, when ear muscle got little moved.
3) if we are using it inside the helmet, then it's like complete ENC where our voice itself will not reach other side of person.
4) faster connectivity with device will only work for a week.

My Ptron has atleast decent mic where other side of person will be able to hear our voice","Very good under 1500

B0D5YCYS1G,4.1,"The OnePlus Nord CE4 Lite 5G emerges as a compelling mid-range smartphone that offers excellent value for budget-conscious consumers. Here's a detailed breakdown of its key strengths and minor limitations:

Final Verdict: The OnePlus Nord CE4 Lite 5G is an excellent choice for users seeking a reliable, budget-friendly smartphone with strong battery performance and a smooth user experience. It may not be revolutionary, but it delivers solid value for everyday use.","My review :
Performance [ 4/5 ] - Gaming Performance good but you'll see some frame drops and lag somewhere while using but a great gaming experience at this price.
Camera [ 3/5 ] - Very limit features in camera app and quality is also not good and you'll find better options in market at 20k.
Battery [ 5/5 ] - Awesome battery life and 80w fast charging is crazy and will take about 40m-60m for 0-100%.
Display [ 4.5/5 ] - Good display quality in this price segment.
Software [ 4/5 ] - Somewhere a decent ui experience but if you are looking for a good ui then Samsung ofc will be the best option.
Conclusion - If you are looking for a phone for normal use and don't use camera that much then it's a great choice but OnePlus as a company is not offering you something special if you buy at by seeing their brand value and it's quite similar to Realme Mobiles.","I recently purchased the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite, and it has truly exceeded my expectations, deserving a solid 5-star rating. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why this phone is an excellent choice:

Design and Build Quality: The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite boasts a sleek, modern design with a premium feel. The materials used are top-notch, giving it a solid and durable build. Its slim profile and lightweight nature make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.

Display: The phone features a stunning AMOLED display with vibrant colors and sharp resolution. Whether watching videos, playing games, or browsing the web, the visuals are crisp and clear. The high refresh rate adds to the smoothness of the experience, making every interaction buttery smooth.

Performance: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite handles everything with ease. From multitasking to running graphic-intensive games, it performs without a hitch. While the processor might not be the latest, it still delivers reliable performance for daily use.

Camera: The camera setup is impressive, especially the 50MP main sensor, which captures detailed and vibrant photos even in low light. The wide-angle lens adds versatility, allowing for creative shots. The video recording quality is also top-notch, with stable and clear footage. However, low-light photography could use some improvement.

Battery Life: Battery life is outstanding, easily lasting a full day with moderate to heavy use. The 5,500mAh battery ensures you won’t run out of juice during the day. The fast charging feature is a lifesaver, allowing you to quickly top up the battery when needed.

Additional Features: The phone has an official IP54 certification for protection against water splashes and dust. The design, inspired by minimalist tones and patterns, gives it a premium look. The 3.5mm audio jack is a bonus for wired earphone users.

Previously was using Nokia 5.3 and the Oxygen OS is very close to vanilla Android experience I was getting on the Nokia 5.3. Will list out the pros and cons,

Pros:
1. Friendly user interface and close to vanilla Android experience
2. Fantastic screen with vivid colours and responsive touch interface
3. Light weight and well balanced
4. Phone ships with a charger, case and screen guard applied. Something rare these days
5. Battery easily lasts close to two days with moderate use such as social media, emails, calls etc. Fast charging is very impressive and charges from 20 to 100% in one hour
6. Sound output is very good

Cons:
1. Can't find much as it has been only two weeks of use but photos captured aren't that great when you compare to Samsung phones innthe same price range
2. The screen guard which came pre applied is bit of a dust magnet","Great phone ,superb camera and price is super affordable as well.

I don't understand that we choose the phone based on the technology to exchange and it is used phone (leave the cracks and dents, just scratch one scratch is not acceptable). The body of refurbished phone is anyway new, and if phone is working fine with all its features, then what is the problem in exchange.

I think Amazon should look into some basic rules of exchange. Some 5 years ago, this service was good but now one scratch on your new phone can reduce the exchange price to zero.",Very good in battery life,5G network not working in this phone,"Nice phone,camera and sound quality is good.",Ok nice color but not performance,Good,Using OnePlus only since its launch.

B01DEWVZ2C,4.1,"My wife uses it for audio editing and she conformed that she can hear a tiny sound too. Quality is good, design is great, very comfortable for long use. Overall value for money. Easy to use, durable functions well. Go for it if you are looking for in-ear headphones for audio editing.","Ordered it on 10th Feb 2023. After using for wonderful 2 years coincidentally, one side of it stopped working on 10th Feb 2025(today). I mostly used it for office meetings and it served the purpose well. Overall sound quality is better. Mic quality is better as well. After 1-1.5 years of regular usage, you will notice some wear and tear on it. Don't expect it to last more 3 years. Happy shopping.","This purse is very good and comes in budget and the quality is also good
Sound quality very good wa JBL","BUT...>>>>>
Let’s know about its DURABILITY according to me when using this daily with care. So according to me this product is not durable at all in terms of its poor quality rubber material based CABLE which usually always tends to get tangled and wears out really fast when kept in a bag or a pouch and hence as time goes by it leads to affecting its performance in many ways in the long run and so my review is based on one of the major issues that i faced and so this is how it started..........
So first of all AMAZON is not at all blamed for the fault of this product as they packaged it well and delivered it on time before the expected delivery date and i am completely satisfied with AMAZON & it’s SERVICES!!!!!
And so it’s the company that did not design this product to last for more than a year or less than that!!!!!!!!

Anyway I Bought this product on Amazon in the MONTH of OCTOBER in the YEAR 2019 and everything went smooth after opening the package as I enjoyed this pair of earphones so much so that I did not realize that it's cable design, durability and built quality was really poor and hence I kept on using it and it never failed on me and always worked well but all of a sudden in the MONTH of MARCH in the YEAR 2020 which is two months from when i posted my review about this product, i had a major issue and it was that the right earphone all of a sudden stopped working out of nowhere while listening to music one day and later it was discovered by me that it would only work if I keep moving the top cable of the right earphone which is attached the 1 Button Remote With The Microphone and so it would start working and stop working as soon as I let go of the cable and this means that there was some loose connection between the Button Remote and the cable which should not happen as it cost a lot of money and jBL is well known company and they have outstanding products with fairly good prices compared to BOSE which is better but really highly overpriced. So currently I will call jBL CUSTOMER CARE and ask them to resolve the issue by either repairing my earphones or if not repairable that replace it with a new one as its still under its WARRANTY PERIOD!!!!!
So I will put an update as soon as I’m done solving my issue!!!!!

FINAL VERDICT: IF YOU ARE ON A BUDGET WHICH IS BELOW RS 600/- or BELOW RS 700/-
THEN!!!!!
AND ONCE AGAIN ONLY THEN!!!!! GO FOR THIS PRODUCT AS IT’S A GREAT PAIR OF EARPHONES UNDER YOUR BUDGET AT A HUGE DISCOUNTED PRICE!!!!!
BUT IF YOU BUDGET IS BELOW RS 1000/- AND YOU LOVE jBL SIGNATURE SOUND THEN GO FOR THE ONES THAT HAVE THE TANGLE FREE CABLE AS THEY WILL DEFINITELY LAST LONGER AS IN MORE THAN A YEAR OR TWO YEARS AND NOT GIVE YOU ANY TROUBLE BUT OBVIOUSLY IF YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT :)

AND SO GUYS I WOULD RECOMMEND WHENEVER YOU PURCHASE ANY PAIR OF EARPHONES OF ANY KIND OF COMPANY PLEASE DO BUY THE ONES WITH THE TANGLE-FREE CABLE AS I HAVE A PAIR of HEADPHONES WITH A TANGLE-FREE CABLE AND IT HAS BEEN NEARLY 3 YEARS BUT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO IT AT ALL AND IT STILL WORKS WELL.

SO GO AND GET SOME GOOD PAIR OF EARPHONES if needed AT A VERY GOOD PRICE ON Amazon.in
AS THEY USUALLY PROVIDE GOOD AFTER SALE SERVICES ACCORDING TO ME!!!!!!!!!!

I will Discuss all the Questions asked Above and will also Tell you How to Identify The Fake Product. And will give you a Solution For Best Performance. Lets Begin the Review :

================
UNBOXING REVIEW :
================

1 - EARPHONE

2- WARRANTY CARD

3- ADDITIONAL EAR BUDS

4- MANUALS

=================
EARPHONE REVIEW : (3.5* out Of 5 Value For Money 💰 )
=================

4* out of 5 for Premium Looks.

4* out of 5 for Build Quality.

4* out of 5 for Comfortable.

3.5* out of 5 for Sound Quality

3.5 * Out of 5 for Bass Quality.

3* out of 5 for Treble.

3* out of 5 for Noise Cancellation.

3.5 * out of 5 for Ear bud Quality

==============================
ADVANTAGES / Why Should You buy :
===============================

1- Premium Looks at this price Range

2- Good BUILD QUALITY in this Price.

3- JBL is a trusted Brand.

4- Good Comfortable while Listening.

5- It has a Mic .

6- Warranty Of 1 year.

===========================================
WHY I Gave Medium Ratings/Value For Money 💰=3.5*
============================================

I got Really Disappointed as for Quality of sound. These are the cons i Felt.

1- Quality of Sound is not above Average. In this price range We can get Higher Quality of Sound from Panasonic she, Skull candy. I was Expecting alot from JBL.

2- i am not happy with the noise cancellation for a Earphone of price 1399 (without offer). I expect alot as i am a Music Lover.

3- Mic is not that Clear , Low voices are Difficult to transmit. Not at all happy with this.

4- If You are really a Music Lover or you like Quality of Music always , i will not Recommend you. There are other options in this Price range.

=======================
How To check Fake Product :
=======================

Step 1- In front of the Box , Under C100SI you will see its Written ""In EAR HEADPHONES"". It Must be Written in white Colour. If its Written in Red or anyOther ,its a duplicate.

Step 2- Turn the Box to back side , Your price will be written in a separate Paper. (Small) like a Sticker. Duplicate will have a Big Sticker.

Step 3- Open the Box , In orginal You will get Warranty card but Not in duplicate.

Step -4 : The size of Mic should be Small, not a wide in comparison with Duplicate.

Step -5 : JBL logo should be Bold and written with Premium .

Step 6- Go to YouTube , Check bass Checking Videos ,if your Earphones are sustainable ,then your is orginal.

=================================
How to Enhance / Get Better Efficiency :
=================================

If you have already Purchased it and thinking how to Increase the bass and Quality, i will recommend Go to Play store, there are plenty of Music apps where to customize basses and all needs. I will suggest Go for POWERAMP music player. I personally In Love with that app.

=============
CONCLUSION :
=============

This product which is 1399 (without Discount) is really Not Worthy for Value of Money. But if this Product is Under 699 (offer) than its a Good Deal if you want a Mic . So for me VALUE FOR MONEY 💰-= 3.5 *

============
MY OPINION :
============

IF You want a Earphone which have A premium Looks with mic Under This price Range then Go for it.

If you want an Earphone Under 500 , Go for Philips Extra Bass . For Mic Mi In ear.

If you want an Earphone under 600-650, Go for Panasonic she , for MiC Sony MDR 150 Ap.

If You want an Earphone under 700-800, Go For Cx 180, for Mic Go for this product.

If You want an Earphone under 1000k Go for One piston.

If you want an Earphone under 1200k Go for SONY MDR XB 55.

IF YOU want an Earphone under 2K with mic Go for SONY MDR XB 55AP.

I have Used all the products and Recommending you. If you want those Reviews, Go to my profile and check the Reviews..

Jai 🇮🇳.","जुलाई में मेरा ईयरफोन डिलीवर हुआ। ठीक 3 महीने बाद दायाँ साइड वाला खराब हो गया। जब मैंने इनके टोल फ्री नंबर पर कॉल किया तो इनके सलाहकार ने मुझे सर्विस सेंटर पर अमेज़न बिल के साथ ईयरफोन जमा करने को कहा। मैं बिल और ईयरफोन लेकर सर्विस सेंटर पहुँचा जो मेरे घर से 25 किलोमीटर दूर था। लेकिन सर्विस सेंटर वालों ने ईयरफोन जमा करने से मना कर दिया क्योंकि ईयरफोन का बॉक्स साथ नहीं ले गया था। सर्विस सेंटर वालों ने कहा कि इसमें सीरियल नंबर नहीं है। फिर मैंने अमेज़न से वारंटी स्लिप डाउनलोड की जिसमें सीरियल नंबर था लेकिन फिर भी ईयरफोन जमा नहीं हुए। उन्होंने कहा कि मुझे कस्टमर केयर पर कॉल करके इसे हाथों हाथ पिकअप करवाना पड़ेगा। जब मैंने फिर से कस्टमर केयर पर कॉल किया तो उन्होंने मुझे बताया कि हाल ही में नियम और शर्तें बदल गई हैं जिसके कारण बॉक्स की आवश्यकता है और इसलिए इसे सर्विस सेंटर पर जमा नहीं किया जा सकता। और यह भी कहा कि मेरे ईयरफोन का हाथों हाथ पिकअप जो जायेगा। इसके लिए मुझे एक प्रक्रिया का पालन करना होगा जिसके लिए उनके द्वारा मेरे नंबर पर एक लिंक भेजने को कहा गया। लेकिन मुझे कोई लिंक या मैसेज नहीं मिला। अगले दिन मैंने फिर कॉल किया तो उन्होंने कहा कि मॉडल नंबर सुनने में गलती हो गई थी जिस कारण पिकअप नहीं हो पाया। साथ ही यह भी बताया कि वायर्ड ईयरफोन के लिए पिकअप की सुविधा नहीं है। फिर मैंने पूछा कि वारंटी क्लेम कैसे होगा तो उन्होंने कहा कि मुझे ईयरफोन की एक फोटो व्हाट्सएप सपोर्ट पर भेजनी होगी जिसमें ईयरफोन अच्छी कंडीशन में होना चाहिए फिर उसे छोटे-छोटे टुकड़ों में काट कर उसका फोटो भेजना होगा उसके बाद शायद 10 दिन में दूसरा नया ईयरफोन डिलीवर हो जाए। मैंने पूछा ये कैसी प्रक्रिया है अगर ऐसा हुआ तो ईयरफोन मेरे द्वारा फिजिकली डैमेज हो जाएगा जो वारंटी में कवर नहीं होता तो कह रहे हैं कि यही प्रक्रिया है।
इन्होंने किसी भी वेबसाइट पर वारंटी क्लेम करने की प्रक्रिया को सही तरीके से नहीं बताया है फिर ओ इनकी खुद की वेबसाइट हो या अमेजन।
इससे पहले मैंने इसके आधे दाम पर boat का इयरफोन ऑर्डर किया था जो 10 महीने बाद खराब हुआ। फिर भी घर बैठे ही boat द्वारा बदल दिया गया।
लेकिन इनके(jbl) नखरे(प्रोसेस) तो दो बच्चों से भी अधिक है।

अतः मैं अमेजन से आग्रह करता हूं कि ऐसे उत्पादों को Amazon choice ना दिखाए।","Best Product,Value for money",overall good quality earphone at this price range,"Sound is good , i used it for my microsoft teams app to take calls, but there is no noise cancellation",Decent quality.

The earphone seems soft and not strong enough but trust me I am the most unmanaged robust user and it lasted soo long.

Sound quality is extremely perfect. Indians have habit of hearing high bass, or in high sound. But this earphone gives appropriate mix of sound. The mic is also sensitive being good for calling.

Cable quality is a worry, and it may need a pouch to protect them. Mic function is okay but catches lot of hiss noise while recording. Not sure how this will sound for phone, teams calls. Warranty registration using wattsapp failed saying ""Product SKU and Serial number missmatched"".

There is like some 'shhhh' sound,"The earphones have good sound quality, a nice design, and fit well in the ears. They are also lightweight. However, they are fragile, and the wire near the jack can get damaged easily.

build quality: Not the best for the price .. very thin..wire,we can expect better...realme buds 2 are the most durable option in this regard...
design:black colour looks premium and shiny at the ears with jbl branding..and buttons feel nice and sleek...overall a good basic design
sound quality:the most important thing in audio product we expect...it serves very well here..i would rate it a 4.5 /5 in the sound for it's seperation and quality of vocals and instrumentals...
if you're a pure bass lover this one's definitely not for you
you can get other options with heavy bass for the price..
fit:fits perfectly for my ear...it won't fall off my ears often easily...also the tighter fit provides some amount of noise isolation from the environment which is a good addition....
Gaming: maneagable ...dont expect footstep sounds and clear directional sounds ... as they aren't meant for gaming....

Finally...would i recommend them over realme buds 2?...
Yes... I've used both....realme for almost 6 months and now got this...
in terms of sound quality... JBL gets ahead...
but in terms of build quality...and controls.. durability...etcc...overall realme buds 2 are a good option for the price...","Not worth the price, quality is bad for jbl","Best budget wired earphones.

B0CVN4DNWY,3.8,"Excellent product for this price range of ₹150-₹200. Using it with my HUMBLE Clip-On Lapel Mic on both my laptop and phone, and it works seamlessly. Also tested it with earphones that have a mic, and the audio input/output is crisp in all cases. The braided cable adds durability, making it a solid buy at ₹218/-",Works well till now with iQOO Neo6. Quality seems durable and there's good fit and finish overall. Cable is braided and ends are secured. The only issue I've faced till now is that my voice on normal calls echos in my own ears. Keeping an eye on it. Overall good product.,"It is awesome, the condition is top notch, and is working with my device, I am using nothing 3a pro and it is working fine.
The packaging was also good and the cable quality was also good.","I recently purchased the audio adapter and I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand it is quite durable and offers good value for money but there are some notable drawbacks that potential buyers should consider.

Durability and Build Quality:
The materials used feel sturdy and it seems like it can withstand daily wear and tear without any issues.

Value for Money:
I believe this adapter is worth the investment. It performs well for basic audio needs and is a practical solution for those looking to connect their wired headphones to a Type C device.

Sound Quality:
The audio output is not as rich or clear as I would have hoped. It lacks the depth and fidelity that audiophiles might expect, making it less suitable for high-quality music listening. Another downside is that this adapter doesn't support spatial sound. For those who enjoy immersive audio experiences, this could be a significant drawback. It limits the adapter’s functionality, especially for users who want to take full advantage of their headphones capabilities.

Connector Stability:
I also noticed that the connector quality is average. When plugged into my phone, the left and right connections feel a bit loose, which can be concerning. There’s a slight wobble that makes me worry about damaging the Type C socket over time. It’s not a deal-breaker, but it’s something to be cautious about.","I recently purchased a Type-C to 3.5mm converter, and overall, it works excellently for audio playback. The sound quality is clear, and the connection is stable, providing a solid experience for music, videos, and other media. The build quality of the converter feels durable, and it fits snugly into my device without issues.

However, there's one significant drawback: it doesn't work during phone calls. When making or receiving calls, the converter doesn't transmit audio, so I can't use wired headphones to hear the other person or speak through the mic. This limits its functionality for hands-free calling, which is a bit frustrating.

If you're primarily using it for listening to music or watching videos, it's a great choice. But if you're looking for a converter that will also work seamlessly during calls, this one may not meet all your needs.","Excellent product, very good sound. Sturdy cable.",I bought an iem headset which has a 3.5mm jack and my phone doesn't have that pin hole. So I had to buy a 3.5 to c type adapter. At first I wanted to go for protronics but I tght this brand builds cheap products. I choose another brand in amazon and that took a week to get delivered. After I received the adapter at first it worked well they next time I unplugged and plugged it back it didn't work. I wanted a refund but the only option was to replace and unfortunately it another week for replacement and I was not there to receive the product bcoz it came a day early then the date mentioned. so the replacement failed and the cust support offered me a refund. After that I went to the nearby shop and bought another adapter which too failed to work after 2 attempts. Finally I bought protronics and it's been 2 weeks and still it works 💯 fine. Calls and music both are in good quality. I recommend everyone to go for it without any hesitation. And important thing is this is cheaper than the failed products I bought.,Excellent sound quality but did not even last a year.,Good product,"Purchased for my Samsung galaxy A16 works good
Only for audio output
Cannot attend calls it's getting disconnected automatically
Cable quality is good we get a braided cable and can see some gold coating on the aux port
Packaging is good
One big advantage in this product is that we are getting warranty and it was very easy to register

Was facing some connection issue it was opening google assistant and gemini later after some multiple attempt it started working normal",Good quality product,Samsung a36 connect .,Gud,"Portronics ikonnect type C to 3.5 mm jack product is to much better, after that buying u have no need to buy a new earphones with C jack and that will compatible your old headphone with 3.5 mm. There wire quality is to much fine and build quality. U I'll also satisfy with this product after purchased. Good Product.","If you want it for a month use or less use them it will be ok but if you will use frequently then it will not properly work after 2 months
Also warranty claim is difficult process so it is not confirmed that your warranty claimed or not
Instead use wireless bluetooth devices",It is a very good product.,"Its a good Product for normal headphones, and earbuds, but high impedance iem cannot be drived by them. Overall good Product",Working with nothing phone 2a,Great! Works well with my high quality sony headphone.

No buzzing sound or what so ever.,Product is useless..stopped working after 3 months,Product is good for the price,it works great. value for money,Works perfectly with my iPhone 15 plus…..go for it😌,Achha product hai,"I recently bought the Portronics iKonnect C Pro Type-C to 3.5mm Audio Jack, and it has been a great addition to my accessories. The build quality feels premium, and it seamlessly connects my Type-C devices to wired headphones and speakers without any hassle.

The audio output is crystal clear with no distortion or lag, delivering rich sound quality, whether I'm listening to music, watching videos, or attending calls. What I appreciate most is its plug-and-play functionality—no additional setup is needed.

Its compact and lightweight design makes it easy to carry around, and it feels durable enough for everyday use. For anyone missing the headphone jack on their device, this adapter is a must-have.

Highly recommended for smooth and high-fidelity audio experiences!","Product is good, High price",Works fine,Strong and durable,"I only bought it a month ago and my cable got damaged. I didn't find it to be of good quality. I expected better quality than this but it didn't come true.

- the sound is little bit less as compared to the direct 3.5 mm jack.",There is a hiss sound.,I am using it for iPhone 16 pro max. Upto now it is working well.

I am using this since 3 week..and not facing any problem.","VERY USEFUL PRODUCT FOR ME, USING WITH SAMSUNG S22 ULTRA","It's useful but the AUX panel comes off, so you have to push it back
These aspects can be improved by the company","This is my first time purchasing a type-c to 3.5mm, so I'm not sure if this one is bad or all of them are just bad.
First of all, when you connect earphones you got a hissing sound and at low volume, it even cuts of dialogues. ( Works fine with music as long as you ignore hissing at low volumes)
All these disappeared, when I tried a headphone. This is likely due to the fact that the integrated DAC is expected drive high impedance Headphones and not Earphones.
I guess it's time for me to resume searching for my missing wireless left ear bud. 🤦",Product is working fine as expected. There are no issues.,"Works fine(although the DAC quality is not too good, it distorts the original audio file.I can feel the difference in quality in an inbuilt jack in my other phone .But since I am not an Audiophile it works for me.)......
Issues: Very loose connection, disconnects rapidly.","Audio not clear there is some noise

The have been using a local 100Rupees cable for 1 month and it was great but it broke.
I thought the sound quality will be better than my old cable but surprisingly there is literally no difference between them.
And note that my old cable doesn't had DAC But this cable does have DAC.
If you want normal cable under 200 Go for it but if you want extra ordinary sound buff or Hi-fi sound clarity go for more expensive ones...",Working perfectly fine great quality,"It does it's job correctly, I use it on Android but somehow it doesn't work with Macbook. Thankfully I had headphone jack in it.
The over-all build quality is nice, If it was not much bulky it'd be easy to carry, as of now it feels bulky a bit.","We can get a DAC chip in this connector. I'm using KZ EDX Pro IEMs, and this connector is excellent for its price range due to its braided cable and high-quality exterior. The mic button works, and you can hear left and right audio clearly. However, if you want better output from your earphones, this connector might not be the best choice.

My IEMs sound significantly better when connected to a 3.5mm jack. You can hear every detail of the music, and the volume at 30 is more than sufficient. When I connect my IEMs to the Portronics connector and then to the C port, the sound quality is significantly lower compared to a direct 3.5mm jack connection. Even at 100 volume, the sound is not as good as it is at 30 when connected directly.

This suggests that the connector lacks an efficient DAC chip. If you're an audiophile, you can consider a better option than this",Working fine with samsung M16 5g and Samsung F23 5g. Go for it!,Good Product and Super Quality. Best in fit and perfect sound quality. Must try for your any 3.5mm jack headphones/earphones and assure the quality of sound.

This product is replaceable within 7 days and not returnable. Like Boat has decided that their products are too good to be not returnable.

Buy this earphone only if you're looking for long battery backup.

Don't buy this earphone if you want to:

- listen music with good bass
- wear during workout
- Uncomfortable with heavy buds

I am not a gamer so can't comment on beast mode feature so I request gamers to review.

Now it's up to you to purchase or not.

Cons:
Ear Fitting- The most uncomfortable earbuds from Boat because it doesn't fit in ears and fall down during even basic workouts like jogging.

Heaviness- I was using a MIVI product of the same range before using 311 Pro and it's heavier than that.

Bass- No good bass in earbuds even after using 10mm drivers. You will get better bass in any local brand.

Style- This is just unique and bigger in size. It's not stylish because the earbuds don't look good in the ear and Case in the hand.

Case design- It's very difficult to put earbuds back in the case because of its so called minimalistic design.

Touch Control- Volume increase and decrease features are not here available on long press and it switches off the left earbud on long press and engages the beast mode on right earbud on long press. That's very annoying for me like what I will do with beast mode during jogging or reading or working.

Warranty: What is the use of warranty when there is no return option available (even on boat website) within 7 days.

Pros:
Battery Backup- This is a double-edged feature of these buds because of long power backup the earbuds are heavy and bigger in size.

Perfect Audience- Students and working professionals who want a longer battery life for their study and work.

Touch Control- Play/Pause (Single Touch on any bud) and Next (Double Click on Right Bud) and Previous features (Double Click on Left Bud) are working good.

Overall, it’s a great product for this price range. The sound quality is awesome, and the battery backup is also pretty good.

However, the charging case is a bit of a downside. It seems to be made of a glass-like fiber material (not exactly sure what it is), which looks good but gets scratched very easily and feels delicate. It doesn’t feel very durable.

Also, there is no noise cancellation, which is a big drawback for me.

Still, considering the price, it’s a solid product with great performance in terms of sound and battery.","Worst TWS headset ever! It is uncomfortable as hell for any normal user as the tws weight distribution ain't properly done, meaning they fall too often.

The first set arrived, and my teenage son tried them. However, he couldn’t wear them securely as they kept loosening up, making him worry they might fall out.

We canceled the second set of pink earphones as they were too big for my daughter’s ears. I used the black ones for an hour today, and I noticed they also loosened up and eventually fell out of my ear.

While the product looks great (although the right and left labels on the earphones are too small to read), and the quality of music and functions is satisfying, the fact that they do not fit securely in the ear is a significant drawback. This greatly reduces their rating in my book.","I LIKE DESIGN AND QUALITY ACCORDING TO PRICE , LITTLE CONNECTIVITY ISSUE WHILE RIDING BIKE ON SPEED BUT ITS JUST FOR 5 TO 10 SEC TO CONNECT PROPERLY.",Good,"Call pr meri voice samne wali ko clear nhi Jaa rhi hai..

B0CRH561RC,4.3,"Build and Design:
Very good in-hand feel. Good and sturdy build. Feels like a long lasting one for sure. A good fit for ears. Feels lightweight and can be plugged in for longer durations.
Sound:
If you're a Bass lover, you'll get addicted soon. The detailed clarity of notes is breathtaking. Not of the high end quality but atleast safe to say it exceeded expectations at this price range.
On flipside, tha bass overpowers the vocal strength, so keep an eye on it.
On the app, I would recommend to turn the ""Oneplus 3d Audio"" mode on at all times. Will be a wonderful experience for audiophiles.
ANC:
Powerful noise-cancelling even with heavy outdoor noises. 3 modes of ANC plus transparency mode as well. You'll feel the deafening silence while indoors if tuned to Max.
App Support:
Hey Melody app is a gamechanger. Allows you to have numerous customisations. It's quick and accurate. Always check on the firmware updates for better listening.
Portability:
Safe to carry around. Pocket friendly as well as grippy at most times. The matte finish allows grippy handling. I would have loved the same for the earbuds as well. But overall ain't complaining.
It got a slider for volume control which is a welcoming upgrade.
Battery life:
Excellent battery life even with ANC on. Can go without charge even for a week with moderate usage. Fast charging support as well.

Flops:
1) The earbuds got a glossy finish. So a fingerprint magnet for sure.
2) It supports LHDC but not LDAC. So phones other than Oneplus/Oppo/Realme and some Xiaomi phones don't support LHDC. A bit disappointing though.
3) Not enough ingress protection (IP) for the case alone. IPX4 is not a welcoming move.

Verdict:
An all-rounder TWS with a premium look and features at a budget price. With the Oneplus 3d Audio you'll feel being in a private concert tuned exclusively for your ear's needs. LDAC would have made it a must buy. Rest assured, this is a blockbuster!
A Highly recommended product.","Great Product. Sound is amazing and crystal clear. Bass is really good. Product battery works as advertised. Lasts longer. Dual connectivity is the BEST (saving me lots of time switching between multiple devices). ANC is not bad, did not expect it to be noise free but works enough. Problem is the fit with my ears. Slips out consistently when i am talking or chewing. Tried different sized ear plugs but did not work. Another annoying thing is in Hey Melody they dont have ability to disable ON CALL touch controls. So everytime ear buds slip out and you try to push it in, call disconnects as thats what the HEY Melody default settings are for touch control. Still compared to my Air Pods, overall it has been worth it for me. Will see if battery holds for the long run.","Review is after25 days using:
1. Sound quality is amazing +fantastic+ Nice Bass & Terible quality.
2. A good quality fiber material used & great build quality.
3. Noise cancellation available with different mode choice option.
4. 3D Sound is superb. Dual driver is different Sound from other's.

5. Buds side TOUCH PANEL working quality is superb.
extra facility in Touchpad: Volume +/- ,, Next & previous selection ,, Play/Pause ,, Noise mode changing & many more.
6. EAR Buds Case build quality also premium quality & looking is fantastic.
7. Battery service good but need more improvement, but call service 4-5 days service & for Music 1-2 days.(Depends on using time)
8. No pain after 1-2 hour continue using.

OVERALL, IT'S A FANTASTIC QUALITY, AWESOME SOUND, USER FRIENDLY.","Title: Great Buds with Amazing Mic Quality – Just Be Careful!

I’ve been using the OnePlus Buds 3 for 10 months now, and overall, I’m really impressed. The sound quality is excellent, the battery life is solid, and the fit is super comfortable. Noise cancellation works really well too.

What I love the most is the mic quality — even while riding my bike, people on the other end can hear me clearly, with no wind noise. It’s perfect for calls on the go. However, the voice clarity on WhatsApp voice messages isn’t that great — something OnePlus could improve.

Unfortunately, just one week after I bought them, one earbud fell under a car during a bike ride. One bud and the case survived, but the other was crushed. I contacted customer care, but since it was physical damage, they couldn’t replace it. Still, they responded politely and explained everything well.

Despite the accident, I can say these are one of the best earbuds I’ve ever used!","I've been using it for about more than 1.5 months now and so far they're performing really well. I've used OnePlus Buds before and my previous one lasted for over 2 years. I've been using these for almost 6-8hrs at least daily and they're getting the job done.
The battery life is good and if you've a fast charging adapter (more than 50W) then it'll charge the case fast.
The mic quality is good for the price, the voice is clear and crisp.
The Transperant mode is quite good and the noise cancellation is decent but sometimes in really loud places it may not feel enough but trust me it's good enough for the price you're paying.
The bluetooth connectivity is fast just like the previous gen of OnePlus Buds and maybe even better since now they're using Google device/My Device to pair it and not just relaying on Bluetooth only like before.
The sound quality is good. Like it's going to feel like you're using something premium when you're using it under the right circumstances and they even let you have all the customisation and Equalizer in the buds settings so you don't even have to download anything else (may not be the case for all devices but for me i don't have to download anything else since it's all there)
As for durability, I'm not the one to just throw my buds around or something like that but they do feel sturdy and even if someone really big/fat person stepped on it, it will be fine or if you dropped them from a high level they should be fine. But the case needs to be protected a bit because if you're too rough with it then it'll get scratches but I've been lucky enough to keep it safe and scratch less (thank goodness for that) and they look good. At least better than the Pro varient in my opinion.

But the only problem I've with them is the fit might not be perfect. Like they won't fall out of your ear or anything but sometimes it feels like (at least for me) that the right bud is falling out of the eat but it's there so it just freaks you out at times or you maybe just reassuring if it's securely fit there but you can rest assured and if you have second thoughts then just wear them and just up and down and change the tips to fit your size.
Overall it's great.","One plus buds 3 is amazingly awesome. As, it has fast connectivity and can see the pop up on your phone just by opening the case and with oneplus smart phone you can easily access all its function in bluetooth section. I can say this because i use oneplus 13r.
Music point of view
This earphone is really made for those who love to listen music. With this earbus you can hear each and every beat very clearly and the sound is very crisp. You easily detect vocals and treble. Although, I will say that sound is balance if it comes to vocals and treble, but the base is on whole different level. As, I love to hear base music, i am giving 5 star due to this, No compromise in base.","Been using it for quite a while now. Overall good sound with good bass. For the price point they are fine but I am comparing them to three other buds I have used/using, 1. Sennheiser CX True Wireless 2. Galaxy Buds Pro 3. Sennheiser Momentum TW3

I wear buds for a longer period of time. These are not comfortable and below are some observations when it comes to fit:
• The fit doesn't feel perfect, always feels like they are maybe not placed correctly.
• My ear gets itchy if I wear them for longer period of time. (Which I did not while using any of the other 3 buds I use). So I believe there is a compromise in earbuds tips.
• Touch controls seem fine and responsive.
• Case feels medium quality plastic.
• An okay app to sync with.

My reason for buying these were to have one earbuds for rough use and didn't want to spend much while having a good sound experience. After using them, I would suggest to check other options and spend a few extra bucks as well.

PS. For sound quality, nothing beats Sennheiser, though bad at connection management!","I purchased the OnePlus 3 In-Ear TWS Bluetooth Earbuds in July 2024, and after 6-7 months of daily use (2-3 hours per day), here’s my honest review. My primary usage includes office meetings and YouTube streaming.

✅ Pros:
✔ Sleek & Lightweight Design – Comfortable for extended wear.
✔ Durable Build – Have dropped them multiple times, and they still work fine.
✔ Fast & Reliable Connectivity – Pairs quickly with two devices.
✔ Quick Charging –
Charging case can be plugged in while using the buds.
Buds start charging automatically when placed in the case.
10-minute charge = ~80% battery, which lasts about an hour.
✔ Long Battery Life – On a full charge, lasts 3+ hours of continuous use.
✔ Customizable Controls – Touch gestures for volume, play, pause, and skipping tracks, configurable via the app.
✔ Good Sound Quality – Clear and balanced audio for the price range.

❌ Cons:
🔹 Picks Up Surrounding Noise – The mic amplifies background sounds, making it difficult for others to hear me on calls, especially in a shared workspace.
🔹 Noise Cancellation is One-Way – Helps reduce noise when listening but does not cut out background noise while speaking. Not sure if any settings can fix this.

🔋 Long-Term Battery Performance – TBD
So far, battery life is solid, but I’ll update if I notice any degradation over time.

💡 Final Verdict:
✅ Great value for money with impressive battery life and sound quality.
❌ Not ideal for noisy environments due to the mic picking up background sounds.
If you can overlook the mic issue, this is a solid buy at its price point!","Sound is good. Fit in ear is not proper to me. Connectivity is seamless. Battery life is good so far.

Sound more balanced towards bass. ANC is clearly working.","It’s an average earbud. Considering having tried quite a few options, I would definitely say it’s good but not worth the price. ANC is ok, Bass is also ok, Dolby effect is ok. Everything is just ok","Sound quality is good , Noise cancellation is Good but microphone is not good",Overall perfect product,"The ANC is quite good.

Go for it without thinking❤️‍🔥","absolutely mind blowing sound output. Take it from an audiophile who only listens to tracks in WAV or FLAC and knows how to recognize an awesome pair of earbuds when he comes across one.
I was leaning towards Bose Noise earbuds, but after watching and reading tons of reviews, i finally zeroed in on these earbuds and took a leap of faith. And boy am I glad I did.
A100% BANG for buck (quite literally I might add).
look no further and order these earbuds today. The app to configure them is called 'HeyMelody' on Playstore. once you have configured and activated the 3D surround sound + the Golden Sound Configuration, you'll be absolutely ecstatic with the sound output of your high res music collection.","This TWS has earned my trust on the OnePlus brand when it comes to audio. I'll be looking forward to recommending oneplus earbuds and neckbands to people, as my experience with other brands has been terrible when it comes to audio quality.

The bass is punchy, the vocals are full, the instrumentals are meaty and clear. The sound is balanced and works well for almost every genre. The ANC is also alright, it works to remove low frequency noises such as rickshaw engines or fans and ACs. It's a step up from 2k INR earbuds for sure.","The battery life leaves something to be desired. However, the mic clarity, audio clarity, Bluetooth connectivity, and ANC are all impressive. The bass is average. Touch volume control is nice. Overall, it's a good product, though it could offer more given its Rs. 4500 price tag.",Suddenly case is not working,If you want good product under 5k blindly go with this there is no need to worry about the product The tws is very good 💯,Worth in this price and sound is good call quality is good value for money in this budget,Good functionality,"My travel partner . Optimum noise cancellation and terrific sound control . Doesn’t miss any beat, u only need good listening skill . Very good product.",Good product. Impressive sound quality.,These were best but unfortunately i lost them 🥲,"Life saver ! Best call quality for meetings , I needed something which will reduce noise when I attend office meetings . This ear buds reduces noise while you speak so your boss can’t hear the background noise . Must buy for IT employees",I think this is one of the best bud under 5000,Good box light weight and slip easy to fit in pocket sound quality is awesome,"I purchased these earbuds principally for calls on phone and for virtual meetings on PC. I have used these buds for about 10 days fairly intensively, and I can say that they meet my requirement for calls very well.

Call quality at both ends is very good. The ANC works well to block background noise to an extent. The microphones also block out background noise to a good extent ensuring that calls can be taken in noisy environments without much interference. I was previously using a ""professional grade"" Bluetooth headphone from Jabra and I can say that the call quality is definitely comparable.

The buds have Bluetooth multipoint connectivity which means that the buds connect simultaneously to both my phone and PC. The buds automatically connect to whichever device (PC or phone) which is transmitting audio.

However, to switch devices, we need to manually pause audio on one device and start audio on the other. There is no other way to force the buds to switch from one audio source to the other. This gets tricky if you are constantly moving between phone and PC - there are times when the buds don't switch over because some app or the other which is transmitting audio (say a browser page with a video which is playing). Having an express gesture for switching audio streams would have been very useful.

Also there is a slight lag when switching from one device to another - dont expect to immediately stop a voice call on phone and immediately switch to a meeting on the PC. You will have a 2-3 second lag for the handover.

There is also no gesture for ""mute"" on the headphones. You will need to pull out your device to mute / unmute. Can get a bit annoying if you are taking a call while walking.

These issues are however minor. The call quality and convenience of the buds is really outstanding. Heartily recommend to anyone who is looking for good TWS buds for use at work.

---

Update after more than a month of usage.

The buds tend to work themselves loose after half hour or so and need to be adjusted. Can be a bit annoying if the buds come loose when your hands aren't free, such as when you are cooking. Of course the fit may vary from person-to-person.

The case is also somewhat flimsy. With just about a month of usage the case has collected nicks and scratches from minor day-to-day wear and tear. Might be a good idea to get a cover for the case.","The product quality is absolutely phenomenal, and I’m genuinely impressed!

Sound Quality & Bass: 9/10 – The bass is rich and powerful, making the audio experience enjoyable for both music and podcasts with clear, crisp sound.

Battery Life: 10/10 – Easily the best battery backup in the 5K range. Nothing comes close!

Noise Cancellation: 75%–80% accuracy – Best ANC in this segment, outperforming even Oppo and Realme.

Instant Plug-Out (auto-pause when removing a bud): 10/10 – Absolutely cool and seamless!

Volume Control (increase/decrease): 9/10 – Touch controls work flawlessly for adjusting volume, playing/pausing, and answering calls with a simple tap.

Call Pickup (single/double tap): 10/10

Plus, they look premium and stylish, with a classy design that adds to their elegance. They fit comfortably and stay secure during use. If you're considering them, go for it—no doubts needed!","using these buds for 6 months

Active noise reduction works well. Built quality is good, battery is good. Overall product is good 👍🏻 Value for this price.","I recently lost my OnePlus Buds Pro, which I had used for over four years and absolutely loved for their great sound quality. Initially, I was skeptical about getting the non-Pro version, unsure if it would match up. However, I’m blown away by its quality!

The customization options in the app are fantastic, allowing for a personalized listening experience. But the best part? The volume sliding functionality! It’s incredibly convenient—not having to take my phone out of my pocket or walk over when it's charging in another room makes a huge difference.

Highly impressed!","Fit is good but it hurts after a while so can’t use for long time, Noise cancellation is good",If you are looking for best audio and best call without any noice go for it .. I've tried multiple earbirds but this is the best under 5k,OnePlus buds is best among all i bought in offer good sound quality good battery backup can wear it for hours without any pain in earlobe,"The low end and bass components felt slightly boosted but can be adjusted in the device settings and optimised.

I can feel discomfort after wearing them a while!

Go for Oneplus Nord Buds 3 Pro - they are much more comfortable, same sound quality and cost less!

Only advantage Buds 3 have over Nord Buds 3 Pro is volume control functionality within earbuds! So if that is must for you then go for buds 3

Hope this is useful!","Noise Cancellation is good for work environment, not sure about very noisy environment but it helps me at work to focus on the person on the other end when on a call

Transparency mode is 3.5/5, some AI would have been great to recognise human voice who is near you so that it can amplify human voice I'm your ear so that you can hear the person speaking to you without taking out the earpiece, else it good for the price.

The dual drivers does their job well, the sound is great, I have zero qualms on the sound side, although dynamic range could have been better, I give sound and enjoyability of music a solid 4.5/5 but 3.5/5 to dynamic range

It can connect to two devices simultaneously and it is a boon for me, it's connected to my S23 Ultra, my laptop and my watch is connected to my phone, so I can easily switch between devices

Bluetooth connectivity is blazing fast, kudos for that.

The comfort of earbuds could be better but see, it is subjective and really depends on the ear shape and size, my ears are medium size, the default buds on the earpiece fits best in my ears and doesn't fall even if I jump or do some activity but I can't wear it continuously for more that 2 hours, which is good for me, I don't wear them more than two hours, and anyway in ear earbuds never feel natural, so that's something one has to adjust with, it could be any brand, not specific the OnePlus Buds 3

Charging is fast and good 6-8 hours in one full charge of the earbuds, with Case, I use it for more than 7 days easily

Case weight is light, it doesn't feel heavy, although the finish is matte and the case can easily slip if you have dry hands like me, I would suggest to get a cheap silicone cover for it

If you can get it for 4k or 4.5k, go for it..",Awasome product no complaints till now I used it more than still it's worth the price and goooooo for it no doubts. One of the best noice cancellation till now no complaints,"Best Quality, Amazing Performance 🥰",Excellent noise reduction and good sound effects.,"writing this review after a while of heavy use

But the item turned out to be just fine, love these- their noise cancellation is amazing. I did a lot of research before buying these. Compared them to sony’s c-500 and 700 too, went to sony to hear them but they cant beat this even tho they are more expensive. The app is also very supportive and adjustable, they have this feature called golden sound and it’s amazing. And I can’t stop talking about the noise cancellation which even has 3 modes in, the highest one make me forget I have anyone talking around me or if I’m sitting in a car or in an airplane, it’s very impressive",Good,Premium quality product good battery life awesome base sound quality is best,Great sound quality and useful features.. But the battery life is disappointing.. The case's backup is even worse which makes it unreliable for long use..,Worth for money,Its good. In the price its pretty good. You can consider it. But the main problem with oneplus is it’s battery longevity. This is my 3rd earbuds from oneplus in 5 years. Its ok ig. (Im a rough user tho),80% noise cancellation. Worth for this price,Must buy.,"First the order was delivered with vroken seal as if it was used product.
But when complain raised, replacement was sent which was perfect. Nice work AMZ👍","Used it for about a week now. The sound is good for the price I got it at (Rs 3700) during the sale. The slide to control volume was the reason I chose this over other TWS buds in this price range. The build quality of the case could have been better, the lid is moving slightly and is not firm.

I've been facing a bug since yesterday, sometimes both the buds glitch out and sound very robotic for about a second, then the sound comes from only one bud left or right alternately. Then it becomes normal, but there is a distinct lag in sound, the latency increases quite a bit, to about 1-1.5 seconds. Today it's gotten worse, happened more than 3-4 times.
Don't know whether anyone else is facing these.",Best for this price segment. Good Bass and Noise cancellation,Very good product,"Durable and phone clarity is great
Works very well for 2 device connectivity at same time.
49db Noise cancellation is better than any other earbuds of nearly same price. Though comparing with over the ear headphones it is no way close.
Charging is excellent just in 1 hour and serves for 8 hour with noise cancellation. Without noise cancellation, can extend upto 10 hour for non stop use. Ofcourse you can further increase number of hour by using less frequent.",I like the product,Great features and is easy to use.

B0D7HZ3KK9,4.1,"I’ve been using the OnePlus Nord Buds 3 for a few weeks now, and they’ve exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is excellent, with punchy bass, clear mids, and crisp highs. The 32dB active noise cancellation works surprisingly well, blocking out most ambient noise during commutes and workouts.

One of my favorite features is the fast charging—just 10 minutes gives me around 11 hours of playback, which is perfect when I’m in a rush. On a full charge, I get around 40-43 hours of total playback with the case, which is fantastic for long trips or busy days.

The fit is comfortable and secure, and they don’t fall out even during workouts. Bluetooth connectivity is strong and stable, and pairing with my OnePlus phone was seamless.

Overall, these earbuds offer premium features at a very competitive price. Definitely recommend them if you’re looking for reliable wireless earbuds with solid ANC and excellent battery life!","I am using these earbuds for almost 4-5 days and for almost 6-7 hours so my review is gonna be long. I will tell some pro/cons about these earbuds.

Pros:

1. Their design is awesome as their fit won’t be giving you any discomfort.

2. Build quality is top notch but not very premium so they kinda justify their price point.

3. Bass is very good so audiophiles can relax, treble is also balanced so audio is not drowned in bass, lastly the mid is crisp so the vocals sound loud and clear.

4. Hey Melody app will add lot of value to already value added earbuds, however pro model and non pro models come with different set of features aka their is no transparency mode in non pro models and no on/off feature.

5. Great touch sensitivity as their are no issues to it and they function perfectly.

Cons:

1. Questionable battery life(not bad), these earbuds claim a lot of battery life but that’s not true at all. You will get 5-7 hours with ANC on and if you turn it off then you might get 7-9 hours which is good.

2. ANC is also questionable as its good but not perfect as you can still hear things if it’s turned on. 49db is just marketing gimmick.

3. Delay in audio if connected to 2 devices, if you connect 2 devices then there will be delay in one device, mostly like a lag when you are listening to songs, that goes away when its just one device.

4. Pricing of Pro and Non-Pro model. This one costed me like 2700 and non-pro model is 2000 and it makes no sense as there are just 2 features missing from non-pro model that is on/off and ambient noise so if that’s not important for you go with non-pro model as 700 extra is just a waste as they sound similar, the 32db and 49db ANC is just marketing gimmick as my friend had non-pro model and it sounded similar to mine with ANC.

Conclusion: Go with pro model if you want transparency mode as that’s something I use a lot and if not just buy the non-pro model. These are very good earbuds. They are also the best when it comes to ANC and other features as same features are costing a lot in different brands. Lastly I am attaching 3 EQ presets (Balance, Vocal, Bass) which are better than the default ones as they are up a notch, hopefully it helps others if they want to customise their earbuds sound profile, you can tweak them if you want something extra.

P.S The Cost cutting with packaging is appalling, I got previous nord buds box and its solid cardboard but this one is just filmsy paper box.",These are an amazing pair of tws for the price. I was looking for a secondary tws to my AirPods pros and I had the cmf buds earlier which never worked well at all with many crashes and connectivity issues plus buggy app support with iOS devices. These offer a great experience with decent sound quality robust design and brilliant battery life great bluetooth connectivity and range. Many tws earbuds don’t really work seamlessly with apple devices in general but with the HeyMelody app and dual device connectivity these tws earbuds do a decent job. The mic quality is good aswell I really haven’t tried the anc yet but it is good enough for the price don’t feel like getting a case because the earbuds seem durable. Overall the product is a solid 5🌟 if you are an apple user these would be a nice choice to choose between a galore of options from different brands.,"The OnePlus Nord Buds 3 are a great set of earphones with captivating features for the price. The earphones are powered by 12.4mm drivers, which produce a balanced sound! I have used these buds for over 4-weeks and i have noticed a few things that should be mentioned:
1. Great sound for the price - the buds come with a clear distinguished should between the mids, trebles, and bass. The balanced sound profile that is available in the application (more on that later) is great for most people. Although, I tend to favor the serenade sound profile.
2. BASS - the bass on these tiny devices in excellent!!! It is perfect for any bass lovers and the bass never outshines the mids and trebles. In simple words, if you are a bass lover.... YOU NEED TO BUY THESE.
3. design - This part of the review is subjective, but I found the design refreshing and catchy. This design is unique as compared to the other TWS which tend to copy Apple Airpods and Samsung Galaxy Buds. These try and create a unique look which I prefer over the simple stem design.
4. Touch controls - Here is where the TWS lose one star. When I first paired these to my device, I tried to use the touch controls which just were not working. I tried to inquire about the reason of this inconvenience and found out that you have to download the app and set them yourself. Although it is already recommended to download the app, some people that do not want to download it are forced to just to activate this feature which should be available from the box. Plus, volume control is not present although it would have a good feature.
5. App - The app is phenomenal. It has had no glitches or stutters. It has everything you need such as your case battery, individual earbuds battery, different sound profiles, ANC, all in a simple easy-to-understand UI. This is how every app should be. App name is Hey Melody.
6. ANC - the ANC on these buds is how it should be. Nothing out of the ordinary, it is just average.","Rating: 4.5/5

They’re comfortable to wear for long periods, and the fit is secure even during intense workouts.

I didn't want to spend a lot on IEMs plus I wanted to see whats the buzz with the mid tier IEMs so got these.
These IEMs block good amount of disturbance from the background while listening to music, I can hear zero to none of the outside noise while traveling in train.
The sound quality is good. The three audio modes in the app are well set. For me the highs and mids are clear and punchy but the lows aren't clear but that's too much to expect for this price range.
The battery life is good. Once fully charged i am able to use it for 3 days. It's used for taking office calls, listening to music and videos while traveling and it meets my requirement here.
I like the case and the buds are also very well built. I do feel an itch while playing it for more than an hour in my ears but I like that weirdly as prolonged usage of IEMs isn't good for our ears.
The controls are very touch sensitive, any bump on your iems gets recognized and your call is dropped, music is paused.
This can be paired with two devices at once and it functions very well.
The call quality is very bad. The sound is very blunt, robotic and unclear when the ANC is on, when it's set to transparent mode then the mic picks up everything around me apart from my voice. So don't go for this if you are looking for good call quality.

I will update my review incase needed.","Review: one plus nord buds 3 Earbuds – A Perfect Blend of Clarity and Comfort

I’ve tried many earbuds, but these stands out for its exceptional balance of sound quality, comfort, and battery life.

Sound Quality (8/10)

The bass is deep but not overpowering, while the mids and highs are crisp and well-defined. Whether I’m listening to classical, pop, or podcasts, the sound remains immersive without distortion, even at high volumes. The active noise cancellation (ANC) works well, blocking out most background noise without feeling unnatural.

Comfort & Fit (8.5/10)

The earbuds fit snugly in my ears without causing discomfort during long listening sessions. They come with multiple ear tips, making it easy to find the perfect fit. However, after a few hours, I did feel a slight pressure in my ears.

Battery Life (9/10)

I was pleasantly surprised by the battery life—around 8 hours per charge, with the case extending it up to 30 hours. Plus, the fast-charging feature gives me an extra 2 hours of playtime in just 10 minutes.

Connectivity & Features (9/10)

Pairing is effortless with Bluetooth 5.3, and the connection remains stable even at a distance. The touch controls are intuitive, allowing me to switch tracks, adjust volume, and take calls without reaching for my phone. The transparency mode is also a nice touch, letting me hear my surroundings when needed.

Verdict: 9/10 – Worth the Price?

At its price point, one plus offers premium features without breaking the bank. If you’re looking for a pair of earbuds with great sound, solid battery life, and reliable ANC, these are a fantastic choice.","The market for wireless earbuds has exploded over the years, but finding a pair that hits the right balance between sound quality, design, noise cancellation, and price can be tricky. Enter the OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro – a product that promises high-end features at an accessible price point. After testing these buds thoroughly, here’s my in-depth review.

1. Design and Build Quality:

Right out of the box, the OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro scream minimalism and sophistication. The black matte finish feels premium, with the sleek design of the buds fitting snugly in the ear. They’re ergonomically designed, making them comfortable even during extended use. At just 4.9 grams per bud, they’re lightweight, ensuring no discomfort even after hours of listening.

The charging case follows the same minimalist aesthetic, with a compact form factor that easily slips into your pocket. The magnetic closure adds a satisfying snap when you put the earbuds back, and the overall build quality is top-notch for the price.

2. Sound Quality:

Sound is where the OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro truly shine. Equipped with 12.4mm dynamic drivers, the audio performance is surprisingly rich. The bass is deep but well-balanced, never overpowering the mids or highs. Whether I was listening to bass-heavy tracks or acoustic music, the sound remained clear and full-bodied.

The clarity across frequencies is impressive, making these earbuds suitable for a variety of genres. The sound profile is natural, with no excessive boosting of any frequency, which is often a downfall in budget earbuds. If you’re someone who enjoys a balanced audio experience with a touch of warmth in the low end, these are perfect.

3. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC):

One of the standout features is the up to 49dB Active Noise Cancellation. This level of ANC is rare to find in earbuds at this price point. Whether you’re in a noisy coffee shop, commuting, or on a plane, the ANC effectively filters out background noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience.

However, the noise cancellation isn’t the absolute best in the market, but for the price, it works extremely well. It blocks out the majority of low-frequency sounds, though you might still hear some very high-pitched noises. The transparency mode also works well, letting in ambient sound when needed, without making it sound unnatural or muffled.

4. Call Quality:

Call quality is often a hit or miss with wireless earbuds, but OnePlus has done a commendable job here. During calls, the Nord Buds 3 Pro performed admirably, providing clear and crisp voice quality on both ends. The ENC (Environmental Noise Cancellation) works well, especially in noisy environments, ensuring that your voice cuts through clearly.

Whether I was on a busy street or in a quiet room, the other person could hear me without any issues. The four microphones integrated into the earbuds focus on picking up your voice while minimizing background noise, which is impressive for earbuds in this price range.

5. Battery Life:

Battery life is another strong point. With ANC turned off, you can get up to 44 hours of playback including the charge from the case. Even with ANC enabled, the buds offer around 9 hours on a single charge and about 33 hours total with the charging case, which is more than sufficient for most users.

The fast charging feature is a game-changer – just 10 minutes of charge gives you up to 11 hours of playback, making them ideal for users who are constantly on the move.

6. Connectivity:

The Bluetooth 5.3 technology ensures a stable and fast connection with almost zero dropouts. Pairing is seamless, especially with OnePlus devices, but even with other Android and iOS devices, the connection is swift and consistent.

The low-latency mode is perfect for gamers, offering minimal audio delay, which is crucial during fast-paced gameplay. I experienced no issues with connectivity, even when moving between rooms or keeping my phone in my pocket.

7. Additional Features and Functionality:

The OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro come with IP55 water and dust resistance, which makes them a reliable companion for workouts and outdoor activities. Whether you’re running in the rain or sweating it out at the gym, these earbuds can handle it without any issues.

The touch controls are responsive and allow you to easily manage playback, calls, and ANC modes without needing to take out your phone. You can also customize the touch controls through the HeyMelody app, available on both Android and iOS, giving you more control over your listening experience.

8. Pros and Cons:

Pros:

• Balanced Sound Quality with rich bass and clear mids and highs
• 49dB ANC – excellent for this price range
• Lightweight and comfortable design for long-term use
• Long battery life with up to 44 hours with the case
• Fast charging (10 mins for 11 hours of playback)
• IP55 rating for water and dust resistance
• Stable connectivity with Bluetooth 5.3 and low-latency gaming mode

Cons:

• ANC, while good, may not match the premium models
• No wireless charging option for the case
• Touch controls can sometimes be a bit too sensitive

Final Verdict:

The OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro are a fantastic pair of truly wireless earbuds that offer a near-flagship experience at a mid-range price. From the balanced sound and impressive ANC to the comfortable design and excellent battery life, they deliver on all fronts. The call quality is exceptional, and the fast charging feature is perfect for those always on the go.

While there are a few minor drawbacks, such as the lack of wireless charging and ANC that could be improved, these are small compromises considering the price point. Whether you’re a casual listener, a gamer, or someone who needs a reliable pair of buds for daily use, the OnePlus Nord Buds 3 Pro are an excellent choice. They’re packed with features typically found in much pricier models, making them a great value for money.

In a single earbud, the noise cancellation is not as effective. Also, the first time I wore them, I felt slight pain in my ear. I feel like wearing them continuously should be avoided for ear safety.","Sound quality and anc for best earbuds looks, builds quality design and durability overall is best. good battery back up and fast charging support",I have updated oneplus nord buds 2 to this buds 3 pro. Nothing changed except design. Everything Same. Don't waste ur money if u already have oneplus buds,This product is very good and sound quality are excellent 😌❤️,"Using it for past 1month. Decent audio, good design. Fits ear well. Connectivity is good.

Can buy.","product was quite good, good enough with anc of 32d, experience of ear buds are excellent, well base not irritated, ballanced vocal with crystal voice, but the draw back is its was quite irritated while keeping long time of ear pods in ear, hold of ear buds are good,battery back is not much as good as in reality, packing of product was great",This product is best and also have best anc and audio quality,"Really good sound - With one plus device this is the best one under Rs.2000/-
Base, trible, vocal everything is balanced. For Rs.2000/- go for it blindly.",Cute. Vfm. Decent amount of noise cancellation. Not completely. Love the green and steel blue. I use it for Zoom sessions. I do not use the mic on it though. Zoom allows for separate mic input so i use the laptop one which is better (Xiaomi). Battery life is good. Charges quickly too in the phone fast charger or laptop charger. Very happy with this purchase.,Extream product 😃,Worth for 1999,"The sound quality is very good, it feels free in the ear, and very worth it in this price quality is very good.","The anc works pretty good, very noticeable especially on noisy roads—not the best, but no complains in this price point. Sound is clear, no boosted frequencies too much.. sounds pleasant. I’m cutting one star off because the one-tap-pause feature won’t work 90% of the times. If I tap twice, it goes to the next track, if I tap three times, it’ll go to the previous track, if I long press, it will turn anc on and off.. but when it’s time to pause, it’ll do nothing most of the times! I have to take my phone out and then pause.",The product quality was great .,Not bad,The product is good but the packaging was slightly damaged outwise the product is good the sound of the buds are clear,"Very nice earbuds, voice quality is also good, ANC also works good. Only thing is app is not upto the mark , very little options to customise",Everything super but connectivity is slow,Nice,"The OnePlus Buds Pro 3 deliver amazing sound quality with deep bass and clear vocals. The active noise cancellation works perfectly, blocking out most background noise. Battery life is excellent, and the fit is comfortable for long hours. A great choice for music lovers and calls!","I'm a college student and no doubt the product has already exceeded my expectations, honestly the battery last very well , the case is sturdy and made of premium material . The 49db ANC. Cancels out everything in the surrounding , its amazing that I'm sitting in my mess with 150 other students talking + ducting noise and the ANC just cancels every noise, it helps alot. The sound quality, punchy bass , in ear detection 10/10.
I gave it 4 star only because the headphone charging pins are at the bottom of box , which makes it risky in future if the pins get loose.","1. Design - look premium but in hand feel like plastic & spacialy it's light weight & comfortable in one hand use with flip, overall very good at this price point. my Rating 4.5/5
2. connectivity - it hase blootooth 5.4 support latest so it helps good connection & use of law battery, it's support dual pairing but some catch (still i hasn't use this feature) many says when it connect with 2nd device the 1st device audio will continue through speaker spacialy in laptop use, my Rating 4/5
3. Battery life - battery life is excellent just because of loudness you never use at maximum volume which also helps to use long, claimed battery life is 11hrs without ANC, but I get almost 11hrs plus battery without ANC at 40 -50% volume at night during watching continues series & with ANC I got about 7 hrs at volume level of 50% because it's very loud, my previous oppo enco air 2 pro is not so loud so I use that at 80% of volume. my Rating 4.5/5
4. Feature - it support 49db ANC which is excellent at this price point comper to any other tws and you can also costemize it, it's almost reduce maximum background noise, transperancy mod is also good, it hase bass wave feature for extra bass, it's support google fast pair, in ear detection, & HD AAC & Dolby Atmos support, but not support any ldac or lhdc. my Rating 4/5
5. Audio quality - This is most important because I shift from oppo enco air 2 pro, you never comper it with my previous oppo buds, oppo best in sound quality, yes if you love bass then it is perfect for you, in detail you will find every best, Clear vocals, separate instrument, good treble everything good but in and it's not delivered perfect final sound in the end, yes you can costemize it from Equalizer which I made & now I m happy with its sound just like my previous oppo air 2 pro not same but almost 95% perfect, my costemized Equalizer setting is -1,0,1,2,1,0,0 & BASSWAVE AT 2nd LEVEL and I use it on Movie Mode in Dolby Atmos which give good sorrund effect with loud clean vocal, i also add pic of my Equalizer setting I use OnePlus phone, My Rating 4/5
CONCLUSION - if you get it below 3000rs around 2700 then it is totally value for money just go for it, you can costemize sound as per your choice I add my settings also if you like, I get it at 2399 in sale, My Overall Rating is 4/5 because I think they can tune it very well, even you will get ear pain after use but after few days you will use to it",Product is good. I m using this with nord 4. Not able to pair with another mobile of realme. Sound quality and bass is good.,Nive,The bass is nice and ability to transform from transparency to noise cancellation feature is awesome.,good,"I bought this buds 20 days ago. Now I am sharing my experience, This buds is awesome for music listening and bass is much higher and better than expected. But the problem I am facing is fitting in ear. Bluetooth connectivity is good. And for gaming purpose it's okay okay you can play with slightly delay in latency. Touch controls are good. Only feeling fitting problem in my ears . Otherwise it's best to invest money. Hope it's helpful",ANC feature is amazing!!Sound effects are good too!!The design is sleek and easy to carry around in pockets and small purses!!Good product for this price!!Battery life is good too!!Worthy purchase!!,"I am a crazy fan of one plus ear gadgets, recently purchased one plus nord earbuds pro but was disappointed.

When you are using the earbuds in noise cancellation/transparency mode, simultaneously you use a mosquito racket. The earbuds absords the electric buzzing from the bat and transmits directly into your ears causing inconvenience.

I am not sure if this is common with all ear gadgets having noise cancellation/transparency features.

I had checked for the same issue with 2 different same new devices. The output was same.

Other than this ,this earbuds is a solid 10/10 for this particular cost range.

I would love if Oneplus identifies and rectifies the issue.",Sound is great but at the time of calling everytime need to press volume key to increase voice. Need to be fix,Good one but poor battery life,"If you want perfect tws under 2000 just go for it
The bass is good
Trubel is fantastic

Connectivity is good
Big thumps up for battery pafomence
Thank OnePlus and Amazon for this amazing product ❤️",Good sound quality,"Used it extensively for the last one month.
1. Good battery backup.
2. Good for calls only if your background noise is very low. If you have cooker, utensils making noise closeby then other side person CANNOT HEAR you as noise cancellation is VERY BAD. I have Nothing earbuds whose battery of one bud has gone bad. That Nothings noise cancellation is lot better under same conditions but then it's price is almost double.
3. Music etc is fine.",Excellent sound quality and Smooth style 🤩✌,"Audio quality is good. But, the build quality is not 100% good. The rubber in the bud is tooo thin that it comes of very often. Other than that i feel its good for regular use.","Everything was going well, the features were good, the look was good but when I was playing music I was able to pause the music but I couldn't play it.
I checked every feature and all were working but the main and basic feature was not working 😕",Very good,Bass quality is superb .. if you re looking for bass then go for it,Just got it with a hiccup of play and pause not working on the single tap tried everything including firmware update but then google helped me with Heymelody app which should there is no function mentioned on single tap so after changing its working fine as of now . Let's hope it keeps going the same way 😅,"Product is good and sound effect and futures are good .
Controls are easy to use and sound clarity is very good.
Worth for the money","Today i received this product. It is awesome and main thing it is comfortable to wear, specially i wore oneplus buds 2r and 2 long tine ago and i loved the fit of it also by trutjng on buds 3 pro it also fits very nicely. The anc is damn too good. Also the app support ( Hey Melody) has various features where other brands dont have. I am very satisfied with the brand and personally love this brand. At this price point I would recommend all of you to buy this awesome tws Nord buds 3 pro.",Im happy with the product. It works just as advertised. & Its affordable.,"EASY TO HANDLE ,
NICE PRODUCT",Still need to improve!!,Good color combination and sound quality,Great product,"Ok, not very good","Iam using one plus z2 neckband for 2 yrs now this . The audio was quiet upgrade. There is no ear pain compare to nechband. Quality also very good . Bass 🙌🙌. This is a best upgrade.
Call quality was like🤡🤡. Voice of opposite person like robot and artificial voice. Nechband call quality was very nice.",Nice,good one,"Product is good with its design, working, functions. Post reset, connectivity worked.
However if you use for an hour, your ears will pain. Not sure why?",Well all the features of this earphones is great but there might be a glitch which i guess OnePlus will remove it in an update of theirs while switching from one app to another it generally doesn't give me the audio for quite a few seconds and also in the dual pairing mode it doesn't work well as well apart from every feature of this works well,"After 6 months review, hard on ears tried all sizes, microphone is ordinary, even at home need to keep mobile close, fails to catch voice. One more peculier problem is that doesn't get connected easily to laptop, sometimes need a reset or restart of laptop.
Battery is okay for a mild user.
Not recommended.","Using it for quite a few months! Audio on call comes with a background noise, which is annoying. Charging and touch are decent. Noise cancellation is good, that is why the extra stars.",I got the best deal for sure I have purchased it for 2k and the product is damm good yeah but some extreme music lovers who have deliema of ANC so it's not too good it's decent but other features are so good under this price range.,Very nice ear buds just lovely!! I love the sound quality and specially i love the noise cancellation part it is super duper!! Highly recommend please go ahead with this ear buds. I am very happy customer! Thank youuu ONEPLUS and thank youuu AMAZON!!!,They sound good ANC is also good but the realme buds 6 have better anc but if you have a OnePlus or oppo then this is better for faster connectivity and they sound better on OnePlus and oppo devices overall good,"All good except battery life. My boult audio buds were more effective in terms of battery capacity of the case.
This docker case supports only twice full charge.",Product was good quality and anc was works good in this price range,"use best and light weight ,good design,nice connectivity ,","Overall Rating: (9.625/10)

Here's a breakdown of the product in it's most prevalent features.
1. ANC - (10/10)
Arguable one of the best ANCs I have experienced. I have used this in 3 different scenarios and it performed incredibly well.
a. Road Travel: Heavy Traffic, lot of noise. This cancels 70% of it without music, and 90% of it with music.
b. Irritating Noise: It cancels out the noise made from keyboards typing, specifically mechanical blue switch keyboards, which are known to be the most annoying of all. In an enclosed room with barely 2 meters of distance and no other noise, these earphones nullifies the constant THOCCC sounds that comes while my neighbor is typing on their keyboard, even when they are purposefully hitting the keys with maximum force.
c. Concerts: This did incredibly well when I traveled and went to concerts and was placed very near to the speaker. Of course it cancelled about 30% of the loudness but I could still hear it, but this alone should be a testament to how well these handle noise.

2. Audio Quality - (8.5/10)
You could in theory get the Sony's earphone range and get better audio but that's not the point. This is close to a 9/10 when you properly EQ the earphones. It's pretty bass heavy, but it doesn't sound muddled, the high tones and mid tones are also heard with much clarity.
Since I am not much of an audiophile, I cannot give you a very well-informed opinion, however if you're the average listener like me, I will recommend this very much to you.

3. App Support: HeyMelody by OnePlus - (10/10)
Don't trust the Google Play Store reviews for this App, it might have been lowered during the initial development of the app, but ever since then, the App does as it is advertised. It allows you to:
a. Do multi-device connection (which works excellently by the way)
b. EQ
c. Change between Noise Cancelling, Off & Transparency modes.

4. Build Quality - (10/10)
a. Case: Made out of a metal I believe, very lightweight.
b. Earphones: Eartips are great, very soft and comfortable during long duration. The earbuds themselves are made out of probably plastic, very very lightweight and barely noticable.","Battery life is not up to the mark. It lasts hardly for one day but the company claims 44hs battery backup which is not even close to actual battery life. Otherwise the product is fantastic good design sound quality, fit and finish all is good. 👍

Giving review after 1.5months usage.",Best in this price segment,Good product,Best earbuds at this price range and has good noise cancellation and good battery life as well .i like it's design .I am using this for nearly for 4 months,"Mast performance, if you have 3000 in your budget then close your eyes and go for it,
Bass quality top
Music top
Call quality wanderful

I am very impressed",Nice product 👌.voice quality is very good,"I've been using these earbuds for a month now, so here’s what I’ve found to be good and bad.

The Good:

Active Noise Cancellation works well.

Sound quality is solid—bass and treble sound great (coming from someone who edits videos professionally).

The mic quality is good; no one I’ve talked to has had any complaints about my voice quality.

Connectivity is reliable; it connects almost instantly (I’m using a OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite, so I can’t say for other models).

The buttons on the buds are customizable and work just fine.

I was initially worried they might fall out since I’ve never used buds before, but so far, no issues with that.

Battery life is good for me. I don’t use them all the time, but mostly for listening to music while working or for long calls. With this usage (2–3 hours daily), I only need to charge them once every 4 or 5 days.

The Bad:

This might just be me, but I feel like my ear canals are on the smaller side. Even with the smallest ear tips, I can’t wear them for too long—after about half an hour, my ears start to hurt, and I have to adjust or take them out. This can get pretty annoying.

The case’s build quality is great overall, and the buds stay secure, even if you shake it. But the hinge on the lid feels a bit loose where it connects to the lower part, making the cap feel a bit wobbly, which isn’t ideal.

Overall:
These are my thoughts after a month of use, and I hope it gives you a better idea of whether or not to buy them.","Those who not have OnePlus 10 series smartphone or above, and have other brand smartphone this OnePlus Nord buds 3 pro earbuds not for them... Because this earbuds full potential shown when it's connect to OnePlus devices ok... So who don't know that plz don't misguide others who have OnePlus smartphone...","Pros:
✅ Stylish and lovely design
✅ Good overall performance
✅ Excellent touch controls
✅ High-quality build
✅ Well-packaged
✅ Strong connectivity

Cons:
❌ In-ear fitting needs improvement
❌ Battery life is just okay

Suggestion:

Improve the earbud fitting for better comfort and security.
Enhance battery life for longer usage.","It's a very good product, I like the quality and material. Functionality is great . Good for gaming, charging is also great . Size is compact and good.","The OnePlus Nord Buds 3 is very good pair of buds for the budget. If you want a reasonably priced TWS, go for this.
It doesn’t pause and play when you take off or put on the buds, it will keep playing anything till you put them on the case.
In iPhone or non OP phones, you need to install HeyMelody app to adjust the settings. Personally, I don’t like the fit, sometimes it feels hard to speak over a call. May be I cant hear myself better while speaking. Just telling I did use OP Buds Z2, it was way better than this.
The OP Nord Buds 3 keeps the charge for a long time, never had the fuss to keep them charged frequently.
The audio is okay, not the best, the default EQ settings is bad. You need to use Bass Boost to listen to Rock or EDM or Pop.
But in the low budget, this gives more for the buck.",Very uncomfortable to keep it for long time. It's hurt the ears,"Well built and it stays in my ear without hurting or falling. Sound quality is great. The tap works fine for double tap and triple taps, facing an issue with single tap. All in all i am satisfied with the purchase.","Good sound quality, but myt ear hurt after ssome time","I don’t think this lacks anything for the price tag it comes for. Great design, light weight, great sound quality. ANC is okayish but what do you expect from 2k? Battery life is massive. App is also pretty solid.","ANC is just fabulous, and sound is not that good but yes worth of money","I used OnePlus Nord buds 1 more than 2 years and now I'm upgraded to Nord buds 3 pro and my experience is good...base is improved very much and vocals, trebles are also great... calling is excellent....I also have oppo enco buds 2 and realme wireless 3 pro...but these are great in clarity but base wise still oppo enco buds 2 is slightly better...but the instrument separation is more good than enco buds 2...fully satisfied for its price...Anc in high mode is great..but I won't use that much high and...for me low anc with 60 percent volume is enough....battery backup also top notch 7-8 hours without anc for sure...just gor for it guys❤️","It came in great condition and the delivery was on time thanks to Amazon . Now for the product 😃 I think its perfect for that price tag the sound quality is AWESOME an the ANC feature even in medium level its perfect almost eliminates all surrounding noises. The build quality is fine even for plastic build and charges really fast in about ten to twelve minutes. It comes with bluetooth 5.4 and obviously its really fast while pairing even with some older devices which comes with older versons (mine's 4.2 yet there was no lagging issue or anything and also it's no Oneplus phone keep that in mind) , it's another feature the IP55 protection from sweat and dust is good for it's longevity and the battery is also enough for normal users like me. Overall performance wise its 9/10 for me considering the budget A VALUE FOR MONEY INDEED 👌 Those who are looking for mid budget buds I would 100% reccomend it for them GO FOR IT.","I bought it mainly for call quality and it's doing better, also sound quality is good too","Battery Life is Very Good but the ANC is average, The main issue is the sound quality, it's muddy with too much base, my OPPO enco buds 2 was better at sound quality",The ANC is comparable with more expensive TWS.

B0BZ3WNQ5T,3.8,Good item. Sticks hard slightly uneven surface,good quality product but price very high than offline shop,A perfect order for home,"First time when I bought it 6 months back, 75% off the tape is good. Remaining tape which was winded over the plastic piece was totally waste. Then again I bought one more & that one is only 25% good Remaining 75% off the tape is unusable because it doesn't have enough adhesive layer to hold one small chrome garnish of my car. Because of this one side chrome garnish came off after sticking on the next day & got damaged. Its not trusted for car accessories. This is not a pure 3m product. This scotch brand good for only transparent cellophane tapes. Now this time I bought 3M Attachment Tape. Soon I will use and review in that page.",Not that strong as they say. Sticks most of the surface but glue is not that strong,"This double-sided tape is a game changer for my crafting projects! It provides a strong bond that holds up well on various surfaces, and it’s easy to use without any mess. I love how versatile it is; it’s perfect for both home and office use!","Very handy, and strong tape...have delivered on the committed expectations.. recommend to use it once.",I but 2 pcs and i used for camara to stick in tiles surface its stand for 2 day not bad but its not use for more the 200 grams its can be use in the car are other flat surface. I did not prefer to stick in walls,"The product is good, however the seller (Cocoblu Retail) I ordered from sent an opened package TWICE. The first time I thought it was an accident, since the product inside seemed genuine. However, the second time I realized the scam.

You see the new version of the tape is wrapped around a plastic core, so that the last bit of the tape is usable. However there seems to have been an old version, that was probably scrapped by 3M as waste, in which the tape is wrapped around a cardboard core causing the last part of the tape to stick to the cardboard and be unusable.

The seller (Cocoblu Retail) seems to be brazenly opening the sealed package and substituting the product with a scrapped, waste version. I hope Amazon checks their inventory and exposes this scam.",Good product. Fulfill the purpose most of the time.,Super strong !,Good,Good,"The product delivers as promised.
Reduced a star for the packaging. The product packaging was broken causing dirt to enter inside the tape but the product was fine.",Good product,50/50 quality,Adhesive quality is not good.,Easy to use,"Good adhesive, I expected it little big for this price otherwise good",It works but not that great. It might be the surface that it is used with should be of a specific type. Definitely not holding the rated weight for my use.,Very good tape,"This tape needs to be applied very carefully for it to work.
I used it to attach a mobile holder to my car's dashboard. The first attempt was a total failure but when I cleaned the dashboard thoroughly with an alcohol wipe and pressed the holder for more than 30 seconds it worked.
Now let's see for how long it holds.","Superb adhesion strength. Does the job well if handled correctly.
I used it to fix my dashcams and TPMS monitor in my car.
The only issue is that the protective plastic is difficult to peel off. You'll have to skillfully use your nails to remove it.","Good product 👌🏻 .. Excellent purchase, I believe .. .. but then .. it's Scotch !!! .. 👍🏻","Item is superbly good.

Ideal for car fixtures and other household fixing.,super it stick for xerox machin sheet,Good product. But packaging was bad. Had ordered 2. One came without its original packaging n the tape was stuck to the amazon packing. Had to rip it out.,Its grip is not enought to handle even 150g backlight or bike and be sure to clean the surface before applying,"Quality is not good the tape adhasive power is very poor , maybe old stock",This double sided adhesive tape can’t support even 500 grams.,Glue on one side (the side with red tape) is more stronger than the exposed one but the thickness is very small.,Wuick dry when packet opened,Very bad quality. Claim on quality of tape is disappointing. Not worth.,"It holds good. Fixing LED tube lights has become so easy. As it gets old, the bond becomes strong. Removal is not easy. It leaves black mark on the wall. Fir permanent fixtures it is excellent.",I received a damaged one.,"Just started using it on my car dashboard, I hope it holds the objects as promised. However, I got a very old roll that was more or less stuck on one side of the spiral.",Adhesive on one side was very weak,In uneven surface it won’t work effectively.,"As mentioned, it does not hold the weight and keeps dropping. It acts like any other simple two way tape and can hold very light weights.",Good product 👍🏻,strong,"Can ne used to stick objects with little wt only, not for heavy duty stickings.",Excellent Product...I was facing number plate rattling issue in my car...used to make a lot of noise...tried every kind of double tape..buy nothing worked..Finally gound the permanent solution in 3M double tape..,Good product but smaller length,Not good,NICE PRODUCT,Ok,"After sticking to bathroom tile, the whole thing is coming on removing peeling tape. Not useful.","Very good product
Hold my name plate very strongly","I would not recommend it to anyone. It’s of no use at all. It can’t be use as a tape for hanging your paintings in the wall, don’t even think about it. Regret purchasing the same",Seems to be a duplicate of the original. Doubtful quality.,I feel the price is high for the quality.,Not as strong as described,"So efficient, so strong",Received open piece,Value for money,Good,Pretty much useless.,Not sticking on the wall,Value for money product.,"Removing the upper layer after sticking it to something, is just a mess, it is so tough...it almost peels of the bottom layer from from what it is stuck...:) other than that the strength of these tapes are damn good. Went for the name 3M...",Highly adhesive material and worth for money,"Ths tape undoubtedly forms a strong bond, which is impressive. However, there are a few minor issues to note.

First, the red covering can be quite challenging to remove, and once removed, the side of the roll tends to remain sticky, making it a bit tricky to handle after use.

Additionally, I noticed that it doesn't adhere well to certain surfaces. For example, after cleaning tiles with thinner, it lost its sticking power. However, I found it extremely useful for fixing all my LED tube lights without the need to drill holes in the walls.

Overall, it's a reliable option with strong bonding capabilities, but be prepared for some minor quirks in its handling and adhesion on certain surfaces.","Superb. yes, that's the word comes into my mind after using this. Tried lots of other options like transparent tapes, dual sided white tape, some other glues or fixing solutions. All of them Either bad in fix or simply difficult to use or apply. But this one gave amazing experience. Tried so far till 3Kg of items. Best on painted walls, but works of wood, laminates as well (should be little rough or something to give support in sticking). Will work on little rough tiles as well. Avoid on too clear surfaces. Highly recommended. After all its 3M.",It doesn't stick on walls. It falls off soon. It is definitely expensive,"Need technique to apply. Make sure clean the surface.
You gotta be fast If you got multiple things to stick with it otherwise it is hard to peel out from some surfaces.",Not sticky,Used it considerably for the higher strength of glue and is working great,This is sticking superbly. But due to its black color does not look good on the wall. Should be white color.,Not worth for money,"Very loose grip, even an ordinary Rs 10/- tape is better than that. It appears the seller is selling duplicate product as I have used 3M products they are of excellent quality","Good product, hold well",Used it to hold my mobile phone holder in car,Combined with 3M primer it holds strong. Must have for pasting stuff for cars/automobile.,To get the strength you are looking for you need a huge amount of the tape 15 cm for 6.5 kg.,Worst product. Very unsticky. It even not able to handle the weight of paper. Waste of money. Don't buy ever,"This can't even last 20 minutes. The description says it can hold up to a great extent, but the truth is it can go off simply in the fan's air.","Had to use it the stick a display on the car dash, worked.
Haven't tried to stick something which would test the product to the extreme limit but seems to be capable.","Nice one, worth money. Don't hang too much weighted product based ad.. That's will be not good idea. But you can easily hang small weighted things like photo frame like things..","Good stickiness. I have a suggestion that the tape must be provided with a box to store, not a disposable packing",The length of the tape is 1mtr instead of 1.5 MTR. Please correct the length in product description. Product quality is to good.,Use a long cut for better adhesion.,"Works like a charm, durable and complies with the description from the manufacturer. Great from indoor and outdoor use",qulaity is not good. adhesive is not good.I think it is OLD stock,"Worst product
Dont waste your money
A 5 rupee’s febi quick is muche better than this
Totally waste of money","I purchased this for installing dashcam in my car. Previous one came with the camera got worn-out after 2 years so I was looking for double side adhesive to fix it again. I specifically looked for automotive usage, and I found this. Installed the camera and it holds good. Initial impressions are positive. Time has to answer how effect this is.","Useful for inside cars. But if you're thinking for using it on walls and bathroom the bonding in it lasts only for a day or 2 even on uneven surfaces. Which is a waste of the tape itself.
Silicone tape from gorilla does a better job","Nice product,","Amazing quality, decent thickness",Ok product not strong as decribe,"Definitely worth it and i will buy again. It solved my problem in one go, just a small piece was sufficient. I ordered a lot of tapes in past 1 year and it didn't solve my problem at all, but this one is worth it. It's expensive that other tapes I bought, almost double the price and i had to pay delivery charge extra 40/₹ because I don't have prime membership. Whatsoever I am happy with my purchase and i am writing this review after few days later and i thoroughly checked it twice whether it's effective or not and it is definitely effective and i would say it's 10/10 from my side. Definitely would suggest you to buy it.","The tape's only disadvantage is that, in contrast to other tapes, it is rolled in cardboard rather than plastic, making it challenging to use all the way through. Because the tape is covered in cardboard, it is one-sided rather than double-sided, so you can't utilize the entire piece.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
B0CHX1W1XY,4.5,"The iPhone 15 has truly surpassed all my expectations. Its elegant design, breathtaking display, and remarkably swift performance establish it as a premier device within the smartphone arena. The camera's exceptional quality allows for the capture of every moment with astonishing detail and clarity. Furthermore, the battery life is notably robust, effortlessly sustaining me through an entire day's use. Securing the iPhone 15 from Amazon, especially with the advantageous deal and discount, felt like an absolute bargain.","I recently purchased the iPhone 15 in Pink from Amazon, and I couldn’t be happier with my decision! From the moment I unboxed it, the sleek design and soft pastel pink color caught my attention—it looks even better in person than in pictures. Phone is lightweight aluminum and glass build, making the phone feel premium yet comfortable to hold. The pink shade is elegant and subtle, perfect for anyone who loves a touch of sophistication. The 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is bright, sharp, and offers vibrant colors. Whether watching videos or scrolling through social media, the experience is smooth and immersive. The 48MP main camera and 12MP ultra-wide lens take incredible photos, even in low light. The details, sharpness, and colors are truly impressive. Portrait mode works beautifully, capturing professional-looking shots effortlessly. The front camera is equally good for selfies and FaceTime. Charging with the USB-C port is much more convenient than before, and fast charging is a plus. The delivery was fast and secure, with the iPhone arriving in perfect condition. The packaging was intact, and setting up the phone was a breeze. If you're looking for a stylish, powerful, and reliable phone, the iPhone 15 in Pink is a fantastic choice.","Full satisfaction
Good performance with fine quality and smooth run having good battery life",i Phone Is Iphone,"Mobile is superb and decent battery need to charge 2r 3 times in a day, mobile is heating sometimes.cemara is excellent.","Just made the transition and here’s my POV on the first ~2 month of use

Pros
- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants
- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here
- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless
- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA
- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome
- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.
- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone
- Apples approach on Security!
- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawless

Cons
- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm
- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchases

Industry memes
- USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much
- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!
- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?
- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for texting

Tips of managing battery health
- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh
- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up
- I charge my phone only using a power bank not direct wired or wireless charging
- Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%
- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service
- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section
- I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc
- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending above

Vendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.

….. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience","Design
One of the most noticeable changes to the iPhone 15 is its new design. The phone now has rounded edges, which makes it feel more comfortable in the hand. It also has a new camera bump that is less pronounced than the one on the iPhone 14.

Display

Quality best",Phone and display quality best,nice,"Everyone know about pros , let's only talk about cons
Battery : worst than I expect . Many says it is iOS 17 behind poor battery life . Hardly 3-4 he if you travelling and your network changes frequently .. worst than my android devices .
Performance : no doubt in performance , it's the best in the industry ,
Camera : undoubtably very good in camera dipartment but I hardly take photos 😁
iOS : verry smooth and many good things are missing . Call recording , call pick up haptic , smart dial and many more little but verry important feature ..
Many youtuber says there is no such use of dynamic island but listen to me it is verry usefull and looking cool too
Price : obviously it's not value for money but it's far better than 13 and 14 launch price which is same . Although this time iPhone 15 far better than 15 pro",Sexy phone.,"It’s believed iPhone 15 is way everyone is looking, people buy for enjoyment, but standard is something we wants, iPhones with standard person can win this","Charges slow, battery life is less than ok, camera is fine but nothing great compared to phones in the price range.

Value for money.,Best performance best smoothness best screen size,Nice phone,Good product,Good phone very smooth and camera quality superb🩵,Good and improved device with latest features sound quality is awesome,"It is very best ,I am happy 😊 Thanks amazon",Excellent,"The display is impressively bright, despite the 60 Hz, which I thought might be a drawback coming from a 120 Hz Android device. Surprisingly, it feels the same. The battery life is solid, providing around 1.5 days for mild phone users. As a developer, with light usage for content consumption and social media, I get around 8 hours of screen on time with 25-30% battery left. It charges quickly to 50% and then trickle charges to 100%, adapting to usage patterns for faster charging. Initially, there were some battery drain and heating issues, but they resolved as the phone learned my usage patterns.

Now, the camera is impressive, especially in low light conditions. Despite lacking a dedicated long exposure mode, the default night option, averaging around 3 seconds, captures details even in the dark. Compared to the iPhone 14 and S21FE, the camera quality is top-notch. The auto portrait detection is a standout feature. Believe me no one explain the real use of that auto portrait theoretically until you try it.

In terms of network, the dual 5G standby supports Vi and JIO 5G (eSim). Inside my house, I get around 500 Mbps, and outside easily surpass 1 Gbps. Call quality is excellent, with two introduced modes in the mic option available in the control center.

This is my personal opinion; I'll update if I find anything noteworthy.","What a great colour , what great features loving it!",As expected delivered the product safely and no fraud done like Flipkart. The product is working great with awesome video recording and smooth software experience,"The pink iphone 15 has very classic baby pink shade.

B0D7MNX9Y5,4.1,Worth the money..... Good quality audio and microphone.,"""I recently received my EarPods (Lightning), and at first, I was concerned it might be a fake product because the wire didn't have the usual 'Designed by Apple in California' text. However, the product quality was as good as the original, which made me suspicious yet hopeful. To be sure, I reached out to Apple’s official customer support. They were incredibly thorough—observing the product via screen sharing and checking every detail carefully. After their meticulous examination, they confirmed that it's an original product. So, if you're thinking of buying this, don't worry—mine turned out to be genuine, and I'm very satisfied!""",Wired quality is poor but sound quality is rich …easy to wear perfect fitting,Product is good but 👂 are pain when using this,"I was initially skeptical about these, but after using them, I can confidently say these are one of the best wired earphones for iPhone users! Here’s why:

🎵 Sound Quality - Crystal Clear & Balanced
• The clarity is insane! I thought my Sony ZX310AP had great sound, but the EarPods bring out even more detail in vocals and instruments.
• The bass is actually really good—not overpowering, but deep enough to feel the beats in pop, hip-hop, and EDM songs.
• Listening to lossless music on Apple Music makes a huge difference! I finally feel like I’m hearing every layer of the song as intended.

🎤 Mic Quality - Best for Calls & Gaming
• The mic is so natural-sounding! My friends say my voice is clearer than most wireless earbuds.
• Perfect for BGMI & voice chats—background noise is minimal, and it doesn’t over-process the voice like AI mics do.

🎧 Comfort & Fit - No Pressure, Just Right!
• Super comfortable for all-day use! Unlike in-ear buds that cause ear fatigue or itchiness, these just sit perfectly without going deep.
• No need to constantly adjust them or deal with silicone tips getting loose.

🔇 No Sound Leakage & Good Volume
• I was surprised that they don’t leak sound much even at higher volumes!
• Loud enough even at safe 75dB levels, and they don’t distort at max volume.

🔌 No Battery Worries - Just Plug & Play!
• No need to charge them, so perfect for long listening sessions without interruptions.

Final Verdict

If you want clear, balanced sound, strong bass, a great mic, and ultimate comfort, the Apple EarPods are unbeatable for the price! Perfect for lossless music, gaming, and long calls. Highly recommended! 🔥",im second time use this product the misic sound that was very clear and sharf im very satisfied for this product thanks for apple earphones,"The sound quality is alright, not exceptional. The cable quality is very weak and feels like it may get damaged anytime. Doesn't justify the price","Sound quality is a little average.

Although the wire is delicate, the quality is far from compromised. Was surprised to find it to be on par with the low ended Chi-fi IEMs, which tend to be a little harsher in terms of bass and treble. Plus, you get it in white! They are lightweight and have infinite battery life lol.",Best,The experience of earpods is spontaneous. The amazon’s delivery is cracked tho.. the package was damaged but the earpods were safe. the sound quality is 10/10 but the bass lovers would get dissatisfied as the bass is neutral. the sound is crystal clear u can hear every minor beats which is amazing! you can say that earpods are just a wired version of airpods so if u have a thing for wored headphones.. go for it!!,Better than chordless,The ear-pods are too good with best sound quality.

5/5 Stars
""I'm extremely satisfied with this 128GB SD memory card! The storage capacity is massive, allowing me to store hundreds of photos, videos, and files without worrying about running out of space.

The card's performance is also top-notch, with fast read and write speeds that make transferring files a breeze. I've used it in my camera, phone, and laptop, and it works flawlessly every time.

The build quality is solid, and the card feels durable enough to withstand regular use. The price is also very reasonable, especially considering the massive storage capacity.

Overall, I highly recommend this 128GB SD memory card to anyone looking for a reliable and spacious storage solution.

After one year when I finally became free, I found out that the card was Unreadable and not working on any device. So, the first thing I did was to search whether the card was under the warranty period. SanDisk gives 10 yrs warranty on its cards but in order to avail it one has to first register on their website & apply for a return request (the company calls it RMA). After that I had received an email from the customer support with a long list of questions. I had replied all of them properly after which they approved my replacement request and told me to visit their customer care center. There's only One customer care center in entire Mumbai which was far away from my town, I had to catch two different trains to reach there. The replacement process was quick since the RMA was approved. I was happy with the service of the customer support.

To test it, I compared it with Realme C12, a 7-year-old 13-megapixel phone. Except for the color grading of the pixel, nothing really has changed! There is NO benefit of any resolution here. It is pretty clear that the 50-megapixel reported camera value by the company doesn't correspond to the actual hardware.

2. The battery and charging are the BIGGEST downside of the phone! The claim that the battery has around 5000+ mAh doesn't seem to be true. It is FAR inferior to my Realme C12 which reports 6000+ mAh battery. Charging doesn't work when the phone is switched on with a portable hotspot, data and GPS are on! So once switched off, the charging works well corresponding to a fast charger up to 90% of the battery charge status, after which it slows down and gets severely struck at 95% charging status. The last 5% take more than 15-20 mins!

3. Sound Quality is pretty normal and ordinary compared to any other phone.

4. The phone actually weighs more and is not as portable as my old 7.5k Realme C12. The camera design is pretty lame and has no performance benefit over Realme C12 in comparison. The circular extension at the back actually makes it difficult to hold a bit. The cameras are far more ordinary with just better color grading.

5. It doesn't support Airtel 5G as Manufacturers admit.

6. The memory capacity RAM is 4G, which is 1G improvement over Realme C12. But for an ordinary user with 4-5 years of use, this shouldn't affect him much, unless gaming or other performance extensive use.",Good,Good product at Competitive Price.. Good specifications..

Others things are still looks ok.",PHONE IS GOOD BUT SOFT WARE IS NOT WORKING PROPERELY FROM FIRST DAY,"✅Comes with default Xiomi dialer so call recording feature is a huge plus point. One may never know when it's needed.

✅Bigger screen size: This has its own advantage and disadvantage. Good to use for elders when font size is increased on a already bigger screen size phone. Safe hand to eye distance can be easily achieved.
❌Issue is that bigger size bigger battery makes it bulky (keep in mind back cover will also add overall weight slightly). One hand use is risky because handling might become difficult for few people.

✅Battery backup: Not sure how much Xiomi has worked on battery backup but so far it's looking decent hopefully it stays this way in future as well. (Only other Redmi phone I used was their debut model in India 'Redmi 1S' that was launched way back 10 years ago and it wasn't so good on battery backup)

✅Updates: Received first update (security patch) today as I write this review.

✅ Charging speed is definitely good.

❌Storage: custom UI phones lack in this. Unnecessary apps, tweaks and customisation eat up system space. I've literally kept this phone as received it 2 weeks ago. No data saved so far and already 23 GB system space is full. 128 internal space in budget segment phones should now be default given size of apps and never ending updates.

🤷🏽Can't comment on 5G since I don't have jio connection. 4G is working fine.
❌Separate budget for screen protector and back cover.

B09N3ZNHTY,3.8,"Pros:
1. The level of volume it gets to, is just awesome, it can get incredibly loud so if you're at the gym, these are perfect.
2. Awesome Bass!
3. Noise cancellation is just great, if you simply put them on without even any music playing, u won't be able to hear things around u very well, it's great for places like Gym.
4. Lovely battery life, I've had them a week and only had to charge the case once, that too for just a few minutes. And the earbuds themselves, leave them in case for just five min and you'll be getting battery for a long long while.
5. They are very comfortable, can be used for long periods of time.
6. Affordable!
7. The touch controls are very responsive, tap to pause, double tap right one for next song, double tap left one for either rewind or previous song. Can also pick up calls just by tapping.
8. Multiple ear coverings are provided with it.
9. Type C port

Cons:
1. The sound quality is not bad or anything but it is slightly muffled as compared to good quality headphones etc. The bass is the highlight so it's great for music, but for movies or gaming, you won't get the most crisp audio.
2. Some connectivity issues, sometimes i have to turn my Bluetooth on and off many times for it to work (this is occasional, not a daily or frequent occurrence) [Edit after 1 month use: it's now a very frequent issue]
3. The mic quality is good if you are using your phone, but for some reason the quality is really bad if you are on PC
4. Sometimes on WhatsApp, the mic will not be detected if you are on call with these earbuds, so you will end up having to take them off to accept a call sometimes. (Not an issue if you are the one dialing) i hope it's just a whatsapp issue rather than earbuds issue.

Overall, I needed these for my gym since they play horrible music there (lol) so I'm very very happy with them
Highly recommended for music and/or as a more affordable option as compared to JBL etc.","After using for a day:
Pros:
1. Value for the money
2. Sound quality
3. Connectivity Range
4. Easy to pair
5. Battery life and Battery indicator in Case
6. Clear call quality
Cons:
1. Unable to connect multiple devices at once

Observation: Pretty decent but gives a feel that the lid was loose while closing. But can't complain for the price","I have had high expectations before buying this particular product. May be because of that I have felt really bad with the product.
1. The build quality
It was full plastic but acceptable at the price range of 1000rs. Scratches easily. The case in particular is kinda cheap and not premium. But the buds are quite good
2. Sound quality
It was comparable with my 3yrs old 200rs earphones. It has really bad bass. The volume in particular is very low. The ANC in this price is good. But don’t expect it conceal you completely.

-The touch controls sucks and not at all usable
-the connectivity with my phone is pretty good
-It didn’t have an app so I was not able to tune it
Battery
-the battery life was pretty good it lasted long
Conclusion
Don’t buy it","Good product it's worth to buy!
Good sound quality!
No ear pains ! comfortable to use
I like this product overall quality","I got there for like 900 really worth it for the price sound quality is actually decent yeah the ""beast mode"" is bs you can't game with them but I had a phone with a newer bt version and the latency was tolerable turned the beast mode on and I genuinely wasn't feeling the latency fitting is decent too and it is portable but the hinge felt kinda weak or not satisfying enough to my liking since day 1 it's been almost 10 months since I bought,now question is should you? No. There's better earbuds available like the oppo enco buds 2 or Realme t110 etc. but they're not bad by any means its just that they're idk 4 years old at this point with a literal 5mm driver battery backup is good but I will say I'm kinda regretting my descision to buy this and not add like ₹500 more for something from a better brand it's good but not in 2025... And yeah the touch controls works on their own sometimes",I’ve used this for a year and at first the sound quality and battery life was fine but now it’s starting to act up. It only charges one side and the other doesn’t turn on at all. Sometimes it doesn’t charge at all. If you’re someone who uses earbuds for long hours then this product is not the comfiest option because it starts to hurt your ears. The charger case is quite big and a little heavy compared to usual one. Good product for temporary use but not the best one for long term use.,Good product. Value for Money. The noise cancellation feature could be better.,"This is my 2nd airdopes 141 buying online I can assure you that this product has an amazing sound quality and build quality
However after 2-2.5 years you may face some problems like one earbud may go dead or the case refuses to charge earbud but it can be repaired through offline shops for around 250-300 rupees","The boAt Airdopes 141 honestly offer great value for the price. The battery life is the biggest highlight — the buds themselves last about 5-6 hours, and with the case, you easily get 30–35 hours of total playback. That’s amazing for long travel days or binge-watching sessions.

The sound quality is punchy with decent bass, which is expected from boAt. Vocals and highs are clear, and it’s great for casual music, calls, and YouTube. Don’t expect audiophile-level clarity, but for the price, it performs really well.

Call quality is okay — the ENx tech helps indoors, though outdoors or in windier places, it can struggle a bit. Touch controls work fine after a little getting used to.

The fit is snug and lightweight, and I can wear them for hours without discomfort.",I have been using these for last 1yrs 5months and only thing the let's me down is that it's silver crome color is getting off after a year of usage. Over all its music quality is better. Other thing is that after so much usages but it's Bluetooth sometimes don't get connected to the previously connected device automatically.,"I just the boAt Airdopes 141 Pro buds few days ago and compared to the previous model ""boAt Airdopes 141 buds"" the sound quality basically same with more battery life and I liked the boAt's Signature Bass sound, and maybe I will edit this review in a few months",Good product along with good delivery system but one thing that can be better is about it's cleanness when it's in the box primarily... It was a little dirty and one more thing.. some more numbers of ear-tips can be Added (6 or 8 in total). Thank you for the great product,"Bought: March 15, 2024 Today: March 15, 2025

Sound quality is too good for music and other stuffs, battery backup was good, like single fast charge lasts upto 2 to 3 hours, and the holder fully get charged in 30 mins, and last upto 4 buds recharges. But, after using 10 months, the the battery of the got weaken and it couldn't charge the buds without the holder connecting to the charger.

The battery in the holder are not replaceable, so I have to buy a new one even though the headphones charges are good. May be their business strategy to make the holder battery weak, so that user buys the same again.","Ear grip is very good, sound clarity is nice, economic price, overall thums up for this device",A good quality product and can used for a long period of time,"I used 20 days done, battery stand 2 to 3 days it's good but buds remove from the cause it's getting 4 hours stand only, voice clarity is good touch is not good it's ok",Best product,Nice product,Good,"Good audio quality, Anc is not satisfied but worth for price, over all good except Anc",Very nice product you can buy,Nice product 😃 bass tagda hai fitting bhi mast hai.

Pros:
✅ Good sound quality for music and videos
✅ No lag while watching videos
✅ Long battery life – lasts for hours without frequent charging
✅ Comfortable fit – easy to wear for long durations

Cons:
❌ Call quality issues – The person on the other end struggles to hear me clearly
❌ Mic or connectivity problem – Sometimes, my voice cuts out during calls

Overall, if you need earbuds mainly for music or videos, these work well, but if calling is a priority, you might face issues. Hoping for a software update or fix from boAt!","Value for money,Good Sound quality",Good...,"“Impressive Sound Quality and Features!”

I recently purchased the boAt Airdopes 141, and I’m thoroughly impressed with the performance. These wireless earbuds offer fantastic sound quality, with clear highs and deep bass that make listening to music or podcasts an absolute pleasure. The ENx Tech ensures crystal-clear calls, even in noisy environments, which is a huge plus.

The low latency feature is perfect for watching videos or playing games, as there’s no noticeable delay between the audio and video. The 42-hour battery life is outstanding, and with fast charging, I’m back to enjoying music in no time. I love the IWP (Instant Wake and Pair) feature—it makes connecting to my devices seamless and quick.

These earbuds are also IPX4 rated, meaning they can handle sweat and water, making them ideal for workouts or outdoor use. The Bluetooth 5.1 ensures a stable and strong connection, and the comfortable fit of the earbuds makes them perfect for extended use.

Overall, the boAt Airdopes 141 offer incredible value for the price, combining amazing sound quality, long battery life, and useful features.

B0D18192T2,4.3,"After several months of consistent use, I am pleased to share my experience with this Logitech mouse. As an IT professional, my work demands long hours on a laptop, and the built-in trackpad often left me with a burning sensation in my fingertips. Seeking a solution, I decided to invest in this compact yet highly functional Logitech mouse. Having used Logitech products, such as keyboards, in the past, I had high expectations for quality, and this mouse has certainly lived up to the brand’s reputation.

Design and Ergonomics:
The mouse features a textured surface that provides a secure and comfortable grip, even during extended use. Its size is perfectly balanced—neither too large nor too small—making it an ideal fit for my hand. The ergonomic design ensures that it sits naturally in the palm, reducing strain during prolonged sessions.

Durability:
Logitech has once again delivered a product with excellent build quality. The mouse feels sturdy and well-constructed, capable of withstanding accidental drops. I’ve unintentionally dropped it multiple times, and it remains fully functional with no visible damage, which speaks volumes about its durability.

Performance and Connectivity:
The mouse connects instantly, ensuring a seamless and uninterrupted workflow. Its responsiveness is impressive, and the low battery consumption is a standout feature, making it a reliable tool for both daily tasks and intensive work sessions.

Overall Impression:
This Logitech mouse has proven to be an excellent investment, addressing my need for comfort, reliability, and efficiency. Its thoughtful design, robust build, and consistent performance make it a must-have for professionals who rely on precision and durability in their tools. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a dependable and ergonomic mouse for long-term use.","Long Lasting ,easy to use","I recently purchased a Logitech wireless mouse, and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. The build quality is excellent, giving the mouse a premium and durable feel. It fits perfectly in the hand, making it comfortable for long hours of use.

The mouse provides a smooth and seamless experience, with precise tracking and quick response time. Whether for work or casual browsing, it functions perfectly without any hiccups. Setting it up was effortless, and the wireless connectivity is strong and reliable.

Overall, I absolutely love this product and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality wireless mouse. Logitech has once again proven its reputation for making exceptional peripherals!","This mouse is actually pretty good , very smooth , I love it. Money worth . I would recommend this.","I have been using the Logitech B170 mouse for 6-7 years without any issues, except for a scroll wheel problem that occurred after six years of use. I must say, Logitech has made this mouse incredibly durable—despite dropping it multiple times from my computer table, it never developed any cracks. There wasn’t a single issue since I purchased the B170 until the scroll wheel problem after many years of use.

Now, after almost seven years, I have ordered and received the same mouse again because it’s so good and comfortable. As someone in cybersecurity, I use my mouse for almost 12 hours a day and have been doing so for 6-7 years. I also use it for gaming, and honestly, buying this mouse was one of my best decisions ever. My new mouse is working just as well as the previous one, and I really appreciate Logitech for making the B170 mouse so reliable.","after 8 months, if i scroll up or down the response is either small page movement, no movement or expected movement, it is completely random and irritating to use.

other functions such as batttery-life, clicks, etc are as good as new one.

considering price around Rs 600, 8 months durability is ok for me

i will buy new mouse and use this as backup/emergency mouse in case main mouse is lost or stopped working.",Nice mouse and grip are better than other mouse noise are much louder than oyher,It’s good product in terms of price.

My apologies to delivery guy.
If anyone can alter the rating, please give him a 5 star rating.
Thank you.",An average and useful product.,"Works greater, This review after 5 months experience, I drop mouse two times stil works good, brought in battery working till. Now, Good one","Hi guys! Bought this yesterday, so haven’t used it much, so an early review. But the most detailed review so please read till the end. Very important points are mentioned.

Looks are cute! It looks really nice and elegant. I am using it with a MacBook Air. So far it seems there are no problems using it. The scrolling is smooth, connection does not drop, and there is no lag. Connection is instant. There is no pairing required. It's plug and play along with the dongle provided with it.

It sits low on the table, feels weighty but not in a wrong way. The battery adds to it's weight, but I have used heavier mice before, and this one feels just right. It has good grip. Nothing to complain about that.

Buttons are nice and clicks are satisfactory, not too noisy; they are just right. Scroll wheel doesn't feel cheap at all, though I believe it could've been better quality. Body is matt finish and doesn't leave fingerprints on it, though if you're someone who eats and handles the mouse, then it'll show the oil prints and that's true with any peripherals. The mouse doesn't feel cheap overall, but it is definitely plasticky, though not in the bad sense. It is definitely not cheap looks wise.

There is an on, off switch on the bottom which is helpful in saving the battery (which is included) when the mouse is not in use. There is no light on the bottom which is good if you have kids in the house who keep flipping the mouse and staring at the super bright light. So that's a good thing and a definite plus! The overall shape and size works in the favour of the mouse, and a variety of users with small and large palms will be satisfied with it.

Now over to a major flaw. The mouse connects only though it's own usb dongle (which by the way comes tucked inside the body of the mouse itself, inside the battery door, which I found mighty impressive) and not through the laptop's bluetooth. Now this means two things- 1. You have to carry around the usb dongle with you everywhere you go, which means if you happen to forget it at home while traveling and carry just the mouse, then the mouse is pretty much useless in that scenario. And worse still, if you happen to carry it out of station with you and bring back only the mouse and forget to pack the dongle, then you're stuck and I don't think you get only the dongle (you'll have to check that with the seller), and then the mouse is left useless in that case. 2. Now over to the problem I am facing, which I did not see anyone else mention in their reviews. I use a MacBook, so it doesn't have USB-C inputs, which means you must buy a connector for it to connect the dongle. I actually had already bought a connector so that was not a problem for me, but you will have to factor in the cost of the connector, which is not cheap, because you want to buy only good quality connector for your expensive MacBook. Of course that is a problem with the MacBook and not with the mouse, but consider this point. It is very important. It will NOT connect over MacBook's Bluetooth. Otherwise, it works well with the MacBook. The only caveat I found is the tracking speed on level 2 is too slow and on level 3 is too fast. You'll have to get used to that thing. It doesn't feel very natural (as the trackpad on the MacBook feels) because of that speed problem, but otherwise, the pointer flows smoothly on screen and doesn't jump around, at least with my mouse. Also, the battery door does make a noise when landing the mouse on the pad, and I feel it could have been made better. But I guess at the cost, you really can't complain too much.

Overall, I think a good buy, but the compulsion of having to use it with it's own dongle is a major drawback I feel. If that doesn't bother you, then nothing else should keep you from buying this product, especially since it is one of the cheapest wireless mice out there at less than 600 bucks, which is what it cost me.",Mouse size is very small.

1. Reliable Wireless Connection: The 2.4 GHz wireless technology ensures a strong and stable connection. I’ve experienced zero lag or dropouts, making it ideal for presentations and everyday tasks.
2. Long Battery Life: With up to 12 months of battery life, I no longer have to worry about frequent replacements. It’s perfect for busy workdays when I can’t afford to be interrupted by a dying battery.
3. Optical Tracking: The optical tracking works flawlessly on various surfaces, whether I’m at my desk or on the go. It provides precise control, which is essential for tasks that require accuracy.
4. Ambidextrous Design: The design is comfortable for both right and left-handed users. This versatility is a huge plus for my team, as we have a mix of preferences in the office.
5. Durable Build: I appreciate the sturdy construction. This mouse has withstood some rough handling, and it continues to perform without any issues. It’s clear that it’s built to last!

And the durability and quality is up to top
But there was a big mistake in it and that was while using it for a game when I pressed both keys together then they were getting stucked to each other and I were being pressed until I had to press them again.

B09R24JBYV,3.5,"I recently purchased the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro in-Ear Wired Earphones, and I am extremely satisfied with the performance! The 10mm drivers deliver excellent sound clarity with balanced bass, making it a great choice for music lovers. The audio is crisp and clear, whether I’m listening to music, podcasts, or attending calls.

The built-in mic is a fantastic addition, ensuring smooth communication during calls. I was pleasantly surprised by how clear my voice sounded on the other end. The 3.5mm audio jack fits perfectly into my device without any loose connections, ensuring a seamless experience.

These earphones are lightweight and comfortable, with a snug fit that doesn’t hurt even after long hours of use. The cable is durable and tangle-free, which is a huge plus for someone always on the go.

Overall, this is a fantastic product for the price. It’s perfect for anyone looking for a reliable pair of earphones with great sound quality. Highly recommended!","Overall good wired earphones and really gives a good experience..sound is overall good, but when it's comes to long life it lacks..
After a usage of 4-5 months it will start to deteriorate and it's a only con..
I would say go for this product..it's really a very very decent wired earphones at this price...","the sound quality is good ..... but the side which is written as right,works as left side and vice versa.",The earphone is not at all durable and has bad sound quality. It does the job of music in travelling on a motorcycle but apart from that it is a very bad product. Again given the cost it works fine. I bought it in January and not even a month after both the plugs stopped working. but by then return window had ended.,"The ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro is an affordable wired earphone with a sleek design and comfortable fit. It features 10mm dynamic drivers, delivering clear vocals and decent bass, making it great for casual music listening. The in-line mic ensures a smooth calling experience, and the tangle-free cable adds to its durability. With a 3.5mm audio jack, it’s compatible with most devices, including smartphones and laptops. While the bass could be better, the overall sound quality and build make it a great","I recently purchased the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones, and while they offer decent sound quality and a comfortable fit, there are some concerns regarding their durability.

Let's start with the positives. The earphones provide a snug fit, ensuring comfort even during long listening sessions. The 10mm drivers deliver satisfactory sound performance, allowing you to enjoy your favorite music and audio with clarity. The passive noise cancellation feature is an added bonus, as it helps immerse you in your audio experience by reducing external noise distractions.

Connecting the earphones to your device is a straightforward process. Simply plug in the 3.5mm audio jack, and within a few seconds, the earphones sync with your phone or tablet, ready to deliver audio.

On the downside, the build quality of the earphone cable raises concerns. Some users have reported that the wires are not as sturdy as expected, making them susceptible to damage and tangling. This weakness in the wire construction may impact the longevity of the earphones, requiring extra care and attention during use and storage.

The ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones come in a sleek design and are available in multiple color options, including Black, Blue, Green, Red, and White, allowing you to choose the one that suits your style.

In terms of technical specifications, the earphones have an impedance of 16 Ω and a frequency response range of 20Hz-20kHz. The 1.2-meter cable length provides adequate flexibility for comfortable usage.

It's important to note that these earphones come with a 6-month warranty, which provides some assurance in case of any manufacturing defects or malfunctions within the specified period.

In conclusion, the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones offer decent sound quality and a comfortable fit, making them suitable for everyday use. However, the durability concerns surrounding the wire strength are worth considering. If you prioritize longevity and robustness in your earphone choice, you may want to explore other options. Nevertheless, if you handle them with care, these earphones can provide an enjoyable audio experience at an affordable price point.","Descent quality and sound, overall value for money","It is according to its price range , now u can judge u want luxury product u gotta spend more u want just average, go for it","Not good product poor material and sound quality is decent and I facing one problem I am conversation with other people so other people was sound coming low and little bit break the sound

Didn't even lasted for 6months !!!😭",Best at 139,Sound quality not good average 2.5 packaging decent 3 size good fit good compatibility worth use not for music lovers only for old music lovers,Volume button ✅✅ is not available,"I recently purchased the Zebronics Headphones from Amazon, and I must say, they are a delightful surprise, especially considering their budget-friendly price. These headphones have impressed me with their overall performance and features.

First and foremost, the sound quality is surprisingly good for headphones in this price range. The audio is clear and well-balanced, with decent bass that adds depth to music and enhances the overall listening experience. Whether I'm enjoying my favorite tracks, watching movies, or even gaming, the Zebronics headphones deliver satisfactory sound without any distortion.

Comfort is another strong suit of these headphones. The adjustable headband and soft cushioned ear cups provide a snug fit and can be worn comfortably for extended periods without causing discomfort or fatigue. The design is also lightweight, making them easy to carry around, which is perfect for my on-the-go lifestyle.

I also appreciate the built-in microphone, which allows me to take calls hands-free while using the headphones. The call quality is clear, and I haven't encountered any issues with voice clarity during phone conversations.

The headphones' build quality is decent, considering their affordable price point. Although they are mostly made of plastic, they don't feel flimsy or fragile. However, I would advise handling them with care to ensure their longevity.

One minor drawback I noticed is the absence of active noise cancellation, which is expected at this price. While they do offer some passive noise isolation, it may not completely block out loud external noises. Nevertheless, it's not a deal-breaker for me, given the headphones' overall performance and affordability.

In terms of connectivity, these headphones offer versatility with both wired and wireless options. I can use the included AUX cable to connect to various devices, and the Bluetooth connectivity works seamlessly with my smartphone and laptop.

In conclusion, the Zebronics Headphones are an excellent choice for budget-conscious consumers looking for a decent audio experience. Their sound quality, comfort, and versatile connectivity options make them a reliable companion for music enthusiasts and casual users alike. While they may lack some advanced features found in higher-end models, these headphones offer great value for money and have pleasantly surprised me with their performance.",Quality is so poor 💀but sound quality is good😄,Nice,Nice,Cheep and best,Working well,"Good and value for money
Good at a price 159 Rs with 6 month warranty but only pause button given",Okay this decent because the price are very cheap,Good,Economy product and efficient product,Nice,"It's been about 3 months, since I am using this earphone and trust me these will meet upto your expectations. Whether it's about sound quality, bass or design and weight of course.

I too have boat's neckband(with prize 8-10 times more than its) and using both for long time.
The sound has a little variation in terms of bass and quality of course(what else we can expect in this price 😁₹180) but good for daily use.

The only negative side I will point out is about the quality of the product. The wire quality is not upto the mark (3/5), you have to handle it carefully and the earbuds are made of plastic material.
Also the the button in the microphone is not at all useful, sometimes it works only to stop ongoing songs but you can't increase or decrease the volume.

Overall I'll give it 4✨under the price I bought.

An important suggestion:-
If you find this product under the range of ₹200.And dont want to go for some high rate earhones, just go for it. It would be a good product to you. Otherwise, you can check out for some other earphones under 500.
Some of them are boat or MI earphones and boult audio bass earphones. 👍

Hope this will be helpful for you guys.🙂","The pin was defective and sound quality need better, But overall ok","अगर आप अमेज़न बेसिक का कोई भी प्रोडक्ट याह देख कर खरीद रहे हैं कि इस पर 1 साल की वारंटी है तो कृपा करके इस चीज़ को भुला दे इस पर कोई वारंटी नहीं है अमेज़न का किसी भी शहर में कोई भी सर्विस सेंटर उपलब्ध नहीं है यह सिर्फ बेवकूफ बनाने के लिए 1 साल की वारंटी डाल देते हैं अमेज़न बेसिक के प्रोडक्ट बिल्कुल घटिया क्वालिटी के हैं एक दो महीने से ज्यादा नहीं चलते, इसके ख़राब होने के बाद आप इनको बस मेल कर सकते हैं उसके बाद यह आपको परेशान कर देगा इसकी वीडियो बनकर बनकर भेजो ऐसा वीडियो नहीं चलेगी दूसरा वीडियो बनकर भेजो इस तरह से बार-बार आपस वीडियो बनवाएंगे और आपको परेशान कर देंगे दो-तीन महीने निकाल देंगे उसके बाद आप भी इनसे बातचीत करना बंद कर देंगे और आपकी वारंटी धारी रह जाएगी",Nice quality,Faced issue with mic.. otherwise its an okay product under this budget..,Value for money 💰,"Working fine and value for money product.

With a snug fit and 10mm drivers, these earphones ensure a comfortable listening experience coupled with satisfactory sound performance. The passive noise cancellation feature enhances immersion by minimizing external distractions, ideal for music aficionados or those seeking solace in audiobooks during commutes.

Connecting these earphones is hassle-free, thanks to the straightforward plug-and-play mechanism. However, concerns arise regarding the durability of the earphone cable. Users have reported issues with wire sturdiness, highlighting susceptibility to tangling and damage. While the sleek design and color variety add aesthetic appeal, the compromise in build quality prompts cautious handling to prolong their lifespan.

Despite durability concerns, the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones boast technical specifications such as a 16 Ω impedance and a frequency response range of 20Hz-20kHz. The 1.2-meter cable offers adequate flexibility for daily use. Additionally, the inclusion of a 6-month warranty provides reassurance against potential manufacturing defects, offering peace of mind to consumers.

In summary, the ZEBRONICS Zeb-Bro Wired Earphones deliver a comfortable fit and decent sound quality, suitable for regular use. However, prospective buyers should weigh the durability issues against their preferences. While these earphones offer an enjoyable audio experience at an affordable price point, those prioritizing longevity may opt for alternatives with sturdier construction. Nonetheless, with proper care, these earphones serve as a budget-friendly option for casual listeners.",Good enough for price. I just use it with my laptop but it pauses itself sometimes and the volume goes high itself. The wire quality is great. I have been using it for some time and it is not at all delicate.,Average product,Sound is normal,Performance is good,The left and right sounds very in terms of bass and volume. For this price point that should be alright. Color is good.,Nice,"First of all, it is not for audiophiles. Not that it is ever conceivable that something in this price range would have cutting-edge technology inside it, or a lot of research behind it.

What it does is to meet all the needs of others – and even exceed expectations. The only problem I found that it is not bi-directional. The left earbud needs to go into the left ear and the right earbud needs to go into the right ear for optimal experience.

Apparently, there is a difference between uni-directional and bi-directional microphones. Uni-directional microphones are designed to receive sounds from only one direction and specifically reject sounds from the other side. This one appears to have an uni-directional microphone.

The other flaw is that there is a bit of difficulty placing the earbuds in my ears. This may or may not be a design flaw, as for similarly designed products there are conflicting reports of both best-fit and worst-fit in equal measure.

Despite the fit problem, I have decided to keep it as otherwise the quality is great. An honest rating would be 4/5 but if you see a lower rating in general when all user ratings from tens of thousands of users are factored in, please note that it appears to be still better than the other products in this category and price range – and by miles!

Love it 😍 where have you been my whole electronic life…,Great quality,Great charging cables. Love the flexibility,"Sturdy, looks great!","It is just what I hoped for , a durable I phone cord. Yay.",Product was as expected and undamaged from transport.,"There’s nothing technically complex about Lightning cables… except that since it’s an accessory, OEMs often use that as an excuse for outrageous markups. I’d buy these again.

As a now-retired mechanical engineer, I’ve never appreciated cabling that didn’t have proper strain reliefs built in; these do. The woven construction of the main cable can take lots of bending cycles without splitting.

My Mac Pro laptop recognized my iPhone when directly connected, and the laptop saw the phone when connected through an ancient USB hub. Also, my Toyota RAV4’s radio recognized my iPhone through the USB port in the dash.
___________________________________

UPDATE (after several more days): I discovered one minor weakness that is (sort of) the cable’s fault because an Apple-branded Lightning cable doesn’t suffer the same weakness. This cable perfectly supports charging when fed from a modern powered USB 3.0 hub. But, this cable WILL NOT charge when plugged into an old powered USB 2.0 hub (circa late 2000+) I have lying around here unless I at least momentarily also plug my Mac Pro laptop computer into that hub.

I hadn’t noticed the bug earlier because I was primarily interested in synching my iPhone with the laptop (both simultaneously plugged into the hub). But if I want only to charge, it’s not happening on an old USB 2.0 hub unless I also plug the laptop in for one second.

This bug doesn’t seem to be the fault of the old hub because my iPhone will charge off of the same hub when I use an Apple-branded Lightning cable.

Still, this cable charges my iPhone even when plugged into a “dumb” USB Type-A charging-only port built into the dash of our Toyota RAV4, and, not surprisingly, it charged my iPhone just fine when plugged into a “smart” cigarette lighter-powered FM-transmitter adapter I use in my Miata.

The incompatibility with the single USB 2.0 hub I have lying around has an easy work-around (plug the hub into the laptop)… but you must know about the bug to avoid wasting time being baffled. While the cable seems to work very well with modern USB devices and accessories providing charging power, it is not quite as universally compatible as an Apple-branded Lightning cable with at least some 25-year-old USB equipment.

Overall, 4-stars because a little caution is required when choosing this cable. As I wrote at the start, I’d buy these again.",worked,"I was surprised at how nice they are. They have a strain reliever on the end by the plug, and they are fabric covered. Good quality feel and all three worked fine. First impression is very positive, despite being made in China.",very good,I love these chargers. I have one in every room! They charge quickly and they are long enough to be able to reach my bed side tables and end tables in the living room. They are a great value.,Heavy duty charging cords.,see aovr,"This product is not the best of all, you can get a better cable on Amazon for three or four dollars more, but if you want to give a gift or maybe you want to use it for a short time, this product is perfect for you. My recommendation is that you can buy a better quality cable that can last longer. But something that is very important is the iPhone certification, this cable does not meet that certification. The certification ensures that all the circuits are working perfectly and you do not have connection problems over time, as I mentioned before, I prefer to buy a better quality cable. I recommend that you take that into consideration before buying.",But I ordered wrong size so I had to return. No problem there!,I use it to run to a laser engraver that is 30+ feet away. I didn't think it would be as good at transferring data both directions because of the length. It works flawlessly.,Cord length is great and works with my iPhone 14 Pro Max.,"Compatible with iPhone 12 Pro Max, charges extremely fast with boost cube, nice convenient length, good value and since you get 3 of them, you’ve got backups, very flexible and easy to use","Sturdy, durable and reliable. Will definitely continue to purchase these",Cable charges good but the fit in the port isn’t a OEM fit will fall out easily,"This braided cable seems to get the job done.

Nice cording too,For the money these are nice charging cables. Would have given 5⭐️’s but there a bit stiff. I would buy again.,"I purchased a three pack of this front and very rarely used them. They were extras basically since I’ve started using them two of them broken and I’ve stopped working because the part that connects into your iPhone has basically bent right right at the tip so the part that goes into your phone to charge it, it is bent right there basically very cheap. I mean, I set my phone down and realized it wasn’t charging so look at it and that was the reason why I didn’t happen And the stuff is cool. Both stopped working on me and I feel like a waste of money.","It’s always a struggle finding charging cables that won’t wear out after a couple of months! So far, these seem pretty sturdy.

I should have only bought 1 instead of 3. 2 of them are not needed at this time.,"Much stiffer and not as flexible as I anticipated, but they work great.","Was uncertain which brand of charger cord to get, but these OHBOX cords looks pretty good and work for me.

The sleeves at the end of the cords are pretty nice and should prevent them from being pulled out of the connectors as easily as the stock Apple and some other 3rd party cords.

These cords worked with my iPhone 13 without any problems. I would venture a guess that those that got cords that report compatibility issues probably received 1 with a poorly soldered chip.","I plug and unplug my cable constantly. And normally there is a subconscious angst that goes with each new plug/unplug action. I can't recall how many replacements I've purchased over the course of my iPhone journey - dozens of new cables. These charging cables are, without a doubt, the best I've ever had. I don't even think about it anymore, these are built like tanks. Great product.",worked well,No es Original pero cumple la funcion,I gave it 4 stars on durability because after about a month of using the charger it started to fail. It wouldn’t charge my phone. I would have to move the cable around in order for it to work. They did charge my phone pretty quick and the cable isn’t that flimsy. Just wish they would last longer than a month.

The connection to both ends are connected great and no worries of the cord trying to fray like the plastic models.,"These are sturdy, reliable cables. They do not fail as many inferior cables do.

I have to try the other two cables regardless they should all work.,Very well made and very visibly durable.,the best charging cords thanks,"The charger is good quality. works great. I waited a month to evaluate the charger before rating it. All is good. This charger replaces one I purchased thru amazon the week prior and 1 out of the 3 chargers decided not to work. I woke up that morning thinking ""phone charged"" great, It was annoying to find out otherwise. I would totally recommend this product again, which a matter of fact I already did. Thank You",So far these are working out great. I’m very pleased with their quality and will update my review if anything changes. Much better than the plastic charge cords for sure.,"In case the actual length matters to you, these aren't 6 ft, they're 2 meters, which is 6 ft 6 in. I mean 2 meters is ~close to 6 ft, but it's actually 10% longer than that. I shopped specifically for 6 ft cords to match another in a place where it matters. I'm disappointed but I'll make do.","So far so good! It charges my phone faster than my normal charger does. The cable is sturdy and I don’t feel like it’s going to break anytime soon if at all. It’s the perfect length for me to be able to sit comfortably and be on my phone while charging it. I love the fact that there is three cables for this price. It’s awesome!

Update: I have had these chargers for a while now. I have went through all 3 chargers. Each charger stopped charging my phone. First I noticed that my battery would only charge to 80% then stop charging. I thought there was something wrong with my battery but kept using the charger. Eventually, the battery would show charging when I plugged in my phone but 2 seconds later it would stop charging. I went back to my original iPhone charger (had gotten this one because it was longer) and my phone charged to 100%. I have been charging with the original charger since and haven’t had any issues so it wasn’t an issue with my phone battery.",These cables are great. They are long and flexible.

I would purchase again.,Good stuff,Works great and charges fast,"unfortunately we all know how poorly constructed any usb charging cable is. the majority of them are horrible & quit working very quickly. i have purchased numerous packages of these kinds of cables for my ipads & iphones over the past few years. this is the only one that has lasted more than a month without the cable shorting out due to just normal usage. had this set about 6 months & waited until the first one went bad to write a review. finally had to trash & replace the first one of the set today. only giving it 3 stars because it should have lasted longer. all cables like this are poorly constructed & should last much longer. however, this has been better than anything i've purchased from amazon or any other location.","Love these cords, and have now got the second set I’ve ordered because I take them with me and leave them!

So far these work better than the prior ones. Hope springs eternal.,"These are great, well made, and come with a cord wrapper that stays attached to the cord. This is exactly what you are looking for.",So far so good! Glad to have a multi-pack! Love the fact they are so long.,"These cords are holding up fine with sporadic use. I try to keep them away from the crazy kids and their tendency to pull and rip everything they can get their little hands on. Honestly, they feel sturdy but, even so, I have this feeling that they might not last but a few months like many items from Amazon. Nonetheless, they are working fine at the moment & priced very well for 3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
B0CP54XBWN,3.4,"I've had my boAt Airdopes Prime for about a week now, and I'm seriously impressed. As someone who uses earbuds daily, both for work calls and listening to music, I've tried my fair share of different brands and models. The Airdopes Prime has quickly become my new favourites.

First off, the sound quality is fantastic. It's clear, crisp, and has a decent amount of bass without being overpowering. I've been using them for everything from podcasts to music to audiobooks, and they handle it all beautifully. The touch controls are also super responsive and intuitive.

One of the biggest selling points for me is the call quality. These earbuds pick up my voice incredibly well, even in slightly noisy environments. I've had no complaints from people I've spoken to, which is a huge plus. And the fit? Perfect! They sit comfortably and securely in my ears, even during workouts. I can wear them for hours without any discomfort or that feeling like they're going to fall out.

Battery life has also been a pleasant surprise. I've been using them for extended periods throughout the day, and I haven't experienced any significant battery drain. The charging case is compact and convenient, making it easy to top them up on the go.

Overall, I'm extremely happy with my boAt Airdopes Prime. They offer excellent sound quality, a comfortable fit, great call clarity, and impressive battery life, all at a reasonable price point. If you're looking for a reliable pair of earbuds for everyday use, I highly recommend giving these a try. They've definitely earned a spot in my tech arsenal.","_Product Review:_

Bass and treble are perfectly matched with each other but fitting is subjective person to person. If u want TWS for dedicated gaming these aren't for you because of latency,"I'm excited to share my review of the boAt Airdopes 91 earbuds. These sleek, Starry Blue earbuds have impressed me with their impressive features and performance.

Design and Build
The Airdopes 91 have a stylish design with a metallic finish, making them aesthetically appealing. The earbuds are lightweight and fit comfortably in the ear, ensuring a secure fit for extended wear [3).

Sound Quality
The 13mm drivers deliver decent sound with a noticeable emphasis on bass, making them perfect for bass lovers. Although the overall sound signature can feel a bit muddy at times, the audio separation is impressive, thanks to the dual drivers in each earpiece [4).

Key Features
- *Long Battery Life*: Up to 45 hours of playback time, making them perfect for extended use.¹
- *Low Latency*: 50ms low latency, ideal for gaming and video watching.
- *ENx Tech*: Environmental Noise Cancellation technology for clear calls and reduced background noise.
- *Fast Charging*: Quick charging capabilities, providing a decent amount of playback time with just a 10-minute charge.

Verdict
The boAt Airdopes 91 are an excellent choice for those seeking affordable, feature-rich earbuds with impressive battery life. While the sound quality may not be perfect, the emphasis on bass and decent audio separation make them a great option for casual listeners.

B0DCZ3WDTB,4.2,"The Xiaomi 4i 20000mAh power bank delivers solid performance overall, but it’s not without some drawbacks.

PROS:
1). High Capacity & Fast Charging => The 33W PD fast charging works well for most devices, including phones, tablets, and earbuds. It can charge my phone multiple times without issue.

2). Triple Output Ports => Useful for charging multiple devices at once. The combination of USB-A and Type-C ports is convenient.

3). Type-C Input & Output => Charging the power bank with Type-C is fast and efficient, which is a big plus.

CONS:
1). Bulky & Heavy => It’s on the heavier side, which makes it less travel-friendly. Not ideal if you’re looking for something portable.

2). Plastic Build Feels Basic => The build quality is okay, but the plastic body doesn’t feel as premium as some other options in this price range.

3). Heating During Fast Charging => Gets slightly warm during fast charging, especially when charging multiple devices.

---

FINAL VERDICT =>
If you need a high-capacity power bank with decent fast-charging support, the Xiaomi Power Bank 4i is a reliable option. However, its bulk and basic design may not appeal to everyone. A balanced product overall – not perfect, but dependable.","When I bought this Powerbank, I didn't found a detailed review regarding this but now as I have used and tested this Powerbank (20000 mAh variant) for 7 days, so I think I'm eligible to write a detailed review for this. Mainly I will write this review based on 4 points, build quality, charging time of powerbank, charging speed and battery backup. So let's start.

1. Build Quality : The build quality of this Powerbank feels quite solid & nice. Its sandstone design texture and round edges makes its grip solid in hands & quite comfortable to hold. Before this I used to have Redmi Powerbank (20000 mAh) which in comparison to this Mi Powerbank feels little ugly in terms of design and uncomfortable to hold. Mi Powerbank feels less wider, thinner & more premium as compared to the previous one.

2. Charging Time of Powerbank : The day I received this Powerbank, its LED indicators showed 2 LEDs blinking which means it had battery level between 25% to 50%. So before using it for the first time, I charged it fully using my standard 10W charger.
One should also note that charging time of Powerbank along with the adapter also depends on what type of cable you are using. Using an old type C cable will take more time to charge it, as current carrying capacity of the cable decreases with time due to frequent usage. Although my 10W adapter is quite old but I have a new type C cable which supports fast charging, so I charged my powerbank with this setup and it took around 8 hours to charge it fully. So you can expect to charge it from 0 to 100% in around 11-12 hours using a 10W charger. Whereas if you use a fast charger like 33 Watt, 65 Watt etc. then ofcourse the powerbank will charge at a faster rate but it will also affect the efficiency and thermals of the powerbank in a negative way in the long run, so keep that in mind.

3. Charging Speed Test : I tested the charging speed provided by this powerbank using 3 different type C cables to charge my 4000 mAh mobile device. Each time I charged my device to 80% using different cables (in second case I forgot to check & it got charged up to 90%) and noted the overall time it took to charge the device. All the results are attached in order as screenshots for reference.
In first case, I charged it with my 2 yr old type C cable which although supports fast charging but the results were not impressive. (Time 1h 43 min Pic)
In second case, I charged it with a new type C cable which came with my tws earbuds but it does not supports fast charging and the results were relatively better as compared to the first case. (Time 1h 58min Pic)
In third case, I charged it with the type C cable which comes inside the box of this powerbank and supports fast charging, and in this case I got the most impressive results. The device got charged to 50% in just 30 min, and 80% in 1h 8min. (Time 1h 8min Pic)
So, it shows that the cable also plays a very important role in fast charging your device which many people ignore.

4. Battery Backup : Other than the above mentioned test results I charged my mobile 3 more times but didn't noted the charging time. So all in all, till now I have charged my device to a total of 406% in 6 different rounds (80% + 94% + 80% + 44% + 82% + 31%) and still 3 LED lights of powerbank are blinking which literally amazed me considering the negative reviews I read about its battery backup before buying it.

So, overall I would say you can buy this powerbank if it suits your requirements and budget. Also if you buy this powerbank then I would suggest you to charge it fully before using it for the first time and test other things during that 7 days replacement period, so if you find any issues with it, you would be able to replace it. I used AccuBattery app to record the battery percentage & time it took to charge my phone.

P.S : Will update the review in future if felt the need to do it.","The Mi Power Bank is a reliable and well-built portable charger with fast-charging support. Its sleek design, durable build, and multiple charging ports make it convenient for travel. With high battery efficiency, it provides multiple charges for smartphones and other devices. Overall, it’s a great value-for-money power bank.","It's so nice it also support super fast charging in SAMSUNG and all buttons are appropriate and all functions are usable
The size is nice
Ease of usage
Value completely worths","The Xiaomi Power Bank 4i (20000mAh, 33W) is a reliable and powerful charging solution. I used a Samsung 45W charger and cable, and it took around 8 hours to fully charge, which is expected for a large 20000mAh battery. The last 20% charges slower for battery protection, but overall, it delivers a worry-free charging experience for my phone and devices.","I purchased the Xiaomi Power Bank 4i (20000mAh, 33W Super Fast Charging) expecting high-speed charging and good portability, but my experience has been a bit mixed.

Pros:
Large Battery Capacity – With 20000mAh, it can charge multiple devices before needing a recharge.
Decent Build Quality – Feels solid and well-constructed.
Multiple Ports – Supports charging for different devices at the same time.

Charging Speed Feels Lower Than 33W – It does not seem to deliver full 33W charging; in real use, it feels closer to 25W.
Heavy & Bulky – The power bank is quite heavy, making it less convenient for travel or carrying around.
Takes Time to Recharge – Due to the large capacity, it takes quite a long time to charge the power bank itself.

The Xiaomi Power Bank 4i is a good high-capacity power bank but doesn’t seem to deliver the claimed 33W charging speed. Also, its weight makes it less portable. If you need a reliable power backup and don’t mind the bulk, it’s fine. Otherwise, you might want to explore lighter and more efficient options","I have previously used 20000mah from MI the first one ever released and that’s working till now. As my brother is using it, so, I decided to get another one for me. So, which brand to go for? Well why not the same one I’ve been using. So, I decided to opt for this. The power-bank comes in a simple packaging with a scratch code on top to verify the product’s authenticity and ghat if it’s been used previously l. Mine was a new one with all the things intact. In the box you get a power-bank 20000mah and a usb type to type-C cable that is quite short, don’t expect much.
The main highlight is the power-bank which has 2-USB type A, 1 USB type C and 1 micro USB type. Micro USB only supports input while USB C can be used for input as well as output. The type A can only be used for output. The max output is 18W and supports fast charging.

1. Build Quality (4.5/5): Aluminium body looks sturdy and durable.

2. Charging Time of Power-bank (4/5): Around 7 hours from 25watt charger I used. Although I think 18W is the max input it supports.

3. Charging Output (4/5): Max 18W fast charging and yes it can charge iPhone and Samsung phones if you are worried. No issues there as I have tried it on my devices. The output may decrease if you charge multiple devices simultaneously.

4. Packaging and condition (5/5): Received a brand new product in working condition and a genuine one in a good packaging. So, KUDOS to that!

# You can simultaneously charge the
power-bank while charging the devices. But,
there might be an issue if you charge two
devices that supports super fast charging
like when I tried to charge my tab s9 and my
phone S23-FE simultaneously when the
power-bank was in charging, my S23-FE
stopped charging after a few seconds.
Although, when I tried it while connecting
tab and iPhones it was working without any
issues. And yes, this is only during the
charging devices while charging the
power-bank at the same time.
# 3 output ports (2 type A and one
type C)and 2 input ports (micro USB and
type C).
# 12 layer protection against short circuit.

Imp to notice:
1. For charging low power devices like watch and earpods, you can switch to low power output mode by fast clicking the power button twice and holding it until the light start blinking one by one. That is low power output mode and it’s a really nice addition.
Just click the power button once to switch back to normal mode.
2. Can switch off the power-bank too, now, that’s something to watch even though I don’t know how long am I gonna use it. Just tap and hold power button once for 10seconds and then you will see the all the lights blink at the same time for 10 times and then it’s off.

So, overall for me as I have previously used the Mi power bank, I hope this one lasts as well.
I grabbed it at ₹1899 in great Indian festival. But, I have seen price come down to ₹1699 after I had bought it. So, keep an eye for the offer for the lower price.
Overall a good buy: 4.5/5","Takes forever to charge, but works well as per initial usage.","My first power bank , I have buy this and using till now it very good quality and can charge multiple devices at ones and I’m specific thanku full to its reliability that I have survived 1 or 2 days of power off I have use this for 2 year and it’s still work you should do to",Powerbank is good and the charging speed is best but for 6000mah phones battery pack of powerbank is less.

The only con i would say is the build .. we get a plastic build compared to metal on older 3i .. and i think mi could have added an led/oled display to show percentage left instead of old style 4 LEDs .

Overall its a very good product with minimal cons . So u can surely go for it",No 1,good,"This power bank is very trendy and serves it purpose as its described. Battery Capacity is 20K and is exactly what it is promised by the company. Value for money and with a good discounted price on Amazon, one can go ahead with this product without any hesitation. Only use the high-watt charger to charge (C type) to increase the charging speed. A low-watt charging may take longer hours to charge the power bank. The shape is simple, sturdy, and elegant. Do not hesitate to buy this one from Amazon.",It has great battery backup with fast charging and sleek design.,Super its a fast charging 🥰,Good,N 😭 hai to unhin ki baat hai 🤞 se 7,"There are many powerbanks from multiple companies out there that will provide you with more features or they could be cheaper , and you would be tempted to buy those instead.
But the fact is there's no need. At the end of a day we just use our powerbanks to just charge our devices and nothing more, and this one is efficient.

This powerbanks battery is phenomenal, when I got the product I first charged it to full ,
and from then I have been using it daily to charge my 5000mah phone once a day.
Its been 13 days now and two LEDs are still glowing, which means it's at 50%juice left. Even if remaining charge is about 30% or something its still mindblowing capacity.

And it has a 33W input and output via type c port, and it's the best in the range.
I can charge the powerbank quickly in about 8-9 hours from 0 to 100 and it will last me about two weeks in my usage.

But just a con is that its very smooth so it's slippery , you might want to handle it carefully or buy a case protection for it.","I wanted this quickly and got it delivered in just 1 Day. Great Packaging. Xiaomi's packing and product unboxing feel is definitely nice. It takes a lot of time to charge to full (as is expected from a 20,000 mah powerbank) and it lasts for ~3-4 Full Phone Charge Cycles Easily. Did not feel any glitches in switch, light, power on etc at the moment. Has been using it for 1 days now. It does not overheat or anything unlike the ones from Ambrane I purchased before. Definitely worth the price in my opinion. Also, amazon order page suggests getting 20,000 mah Amazon Basics product as a replacement for cheaper price when I go through the purchase page. I would not opt that. Redmi's quality would definitely be better built than Amazon Basic product (fully my opinion).",Not Good,Trustable product,"Best quality capacity is too good , easy to transport, multiple use, comfortable, and easy to use",I like the product by feature but there is a issue about capacity it's 20k mah but my 5k mah phone charge only 3 times .

It can charge my phone multiple times on a full battery charge,Using it today also,"Quality is good, idk sometimes it stops working for few minutes and becomes normal too. Takes more time to charge (for me 8 and half hours which is quite more compared to others). Easy to carry. Power level is Good.",Product thikk hai lekin bill acche se nhi diya hai aadha kataa hua bill bheja gya hai,"Charges my phone 5 times 20% to 100%.
Good fast charging.
No heating issues.
Powerbank 0 to 100% full charge in approx 5 hours.

Initially, it worked fine, but after a few months, it started developing double-click issues—a single click often gets registered as a double click, which is very annoying. The scroll wheel also becomes unresponsive or skips steps at times.

This seems to be a common issue with this model. For the price, it’s okay short-term, but not reliable for long-term use.

I relied on it until 2022, when a colleague mocked me for still using a wired mouse. Trying to fit in, I naively replaced it with a wireless alternative that cost five times as much but couldn’t compare to this brilliant device.

Shortly after, I was laid off from that job.

Despite its reliability, I abandoned my loyal Dell mouse and adjusted to the new one, a sleek but uncomfortable gadget that didn’t even fit my hands properly. That overpriced piece of plastic lasted a mere 1.5 years.

Now, I’ve returned to my faithful companion, vowing to never stray again. This time, it’s for the long haul.",Good,"Great mouse for the price. The design is simple and comfortable for long hours of use. The tracking on smooth surface is not smooth or accurate, So we also need to buy mouse pad.

B07WHRZRD7,4.3,"After using 6 days with 186 apps its performance very good. Under 21k (8gb ram and 256 internal) its a best phone display is also good smoot touch network range also better than other phone range . Back camera is nice, front is good . No heating no hanging with continuous use. After all battery is best I used with hotspot my 2nd phone was connect with this phone's hotspot and after full day uses its consume only 50 % and if I used it like normally call and some videos watch on you tube it can go almost 3 days. So if you are looking best phone in battery performance and everything under 21-22k go ahead for IQOO Z9 S . You will be always happy to buy this phone . And last point phone is very sexy slim. I only disappointed with amazon delivery services","1. Look wise premium as curved AMOLED 120 Hz display and curved back pannel provided. 5/5
2. Camera decent rating 4/5
3. Battery 5500 mah lasting 1.5 day for heavy users and charged 💯 % in 50 minutes. 5/5

Everything is good like battery , display,camera , processor etc
And delivery of Amazon is also good.","The device is the absolute best when it comes to being overall balanced in all sectors, within the 20k price range. The gaming isnt bad at all, easily 60+ fps on high settings in most games.. smooth experience overall with 120hz refresh rate and very nice 4k support. Enjoyable 5500 mah battery. Extended use may cause a little bit of heating as in my personal case but other than that, the phone charges in about an hour from 0 to 100 and the backup lasts for a day and a half. Only thing i would change in this phone is a little heating issue. Go for it under 20k.","Really very good, I have purchased it to my dad.

Decent Battery Back-up
It could have better with gorilla glass protection & flat screen

(Please Provide Customers with 2 option Flat Sceeen & Curved Screen)

Everything else is superb in this price range i usually don't write any review but for this product in wanted to write !

😃 Buy it you won't regret","This is my first iqoo device and i must say its amazing. There are more pros in device than cons and I must say no other phone can beat this in this particular price segment.
Design and Build (9/10)-
The phone feels quite sleek and comfortable in hand. Weighing just about 180g and about 7.5mm thick. This phone is by far the slimmest and lightest 5500Mah phone I have ever seen. Even slimmer and slighter than many 5000Mah phone is the market. Ther design language is taken from newly launched Vivo v40 series and this phone is exact replica or little toned down version of Vivo V40e. So you are getting a 28k V40e phone under 20k. A sweet deal right.

Display(8.5/10) -- The display is a typical 120Hz, Oled panel with deep black and around 1000 nits of peak brightness which is more than enough in outdoor environment. Colours are punchy and crisp. You get different colour modes which you can set as per your taste.

Camera (9/10)- Camera is just outstanding. I have never seen such an amazing low light performance from any 15-20k phones in the recent times. The camera balances light very well and even in backlite situation the photos are amazing. The 2x potraits are awesome coupled with various background bokeh modes. Colours are good and dynamic range is fantastic. This phone is camera beast in 18k and I must say Well done Iqoo. They focused on giving 1 very good camera rather than two or three average cameras. Many brands give useless 8MP wide angle camera and mediocre primary camera in this range. If wide angle is your priority than you can go with Iqoo z9s pro model.

Performance(9/10)--
This phone can handle days to day task very smoothly with no zitter or lag. Games run smoothly and 60 fps constant in BGMI.
Not much cpu throttling or heating issue seen so far. This phone has antutu of around 700k which is very good for mid rangers under 20k.

Battery (10/10)--
Battery is just another major USP of this phone. I don't know how they were able to provide such high quality 5500mah battery in such a slim and lightweight phone. The battery backup in normal usage with 120Hz and 5g enable is around 12 Hours(SOT) and if you disable 120Hz and use Wifi the SOT can reach as high as 16Hours(Look at the screenshot). Mind blowing right?. I too was shocked when I used this phone full 2 days with sot of 16 hours. For gamers this can last about 7-8 hours of continuous gaming and for casual users like me easily 1.5 to 2 days on wifi and 1.5 days on 5g. No heating issues while charging and time taken for full charge is 1hour with 45W vivo flash charger.

Software and other features (7/10)--
The funtouch os 14 though very feature rich is not regarded among the top skins in android world but I must say funtouch has been improving a lot in past 3-4 years and is slowly adopting to stock android looks. The main issue which I faced is animation are not very smooth and UI elements lack a consistency in design language (edit-After funtouch OS15 ui is very smooth and animation are silky smooth now). Sometimes minimising an app shows double animation. Btw I have not faced any hanging issue in this phone. Bloatware are present and many can't be disabled as well like vstore,vivo browser jovi home etc. color os or realme os atleast allow user to disable such bloatwares. Vivo should introduce origin os in India as well. Widgets are very poor and there is no option of big app folders as well(after android 15 feature is added)

Speakers, Haptics and connectivity-
Speakers are stereo and quite loud. Not louder than many realme or moto phones but when increasing the volume boost upto 300 percent the sound is indeed very loud though bass is less.
Haptics are not x axis linear 4d motor which you see in many midrange and flagship these days but normal Ghurr Ghurr type vibration motor. Connectivity is very good no issues with 4g or 5g. Even VoNR is supported in this phone.

Overall it is a very good phone under 20k. Hope all the software optimisations like animation, icons and widgets get polished in funtouch os 15.

Update- After funtouch os 15 update animation is now more smoother than before and new widgets are also added.","So if u want best phone under this range of price this is the best choice. Camera quality is best . I am using this phone since 4 months, their is no any bug or problem related phone this has best camera quality i enjoy taking pictures with it battery is fast chargeable and phone is very smooth and fast for usages. It has best processor very speed their no any heating issue connectivity is quite fast.
Their are 2 drawbacks of this phone that
१. It doesn't have audio jack
२. No ultra wide angle cam","After a long wait, finally I get the oynx green z9s. This is just my first day review, I will update it after a week of usage and then again after one or two months as long term. Now, as a first day usage, I am overall satisfied with the device. Below I am dividing the pros and cons of the phone as per my observation.

Pros:
1. The screen is really good and vibrant, so people will like the big colourful screen for sure.
2. The app animations and other transitions are really smooth.
3. The aura light feature, though feels more like a gimmick, it's a cute touch of added feature, I kind of like it while it lights up with the orange whitish colour.
4. I am happy with the update speed, I mean right after the phone is set up, I got latest security updates of October, whereas many costlier devices couldnot provide a timely update.
5. The sound is also good as per price and the sound boost option does help in noisy conditions.
6. The design is really sleek, even with 5500mah battery, it feels so light to hold, the curved displays in both sides make it even slimmer to hold.

Cons:
1. The 120hz refresh is not optimized fully, I feel like that, I mean in many apps, it's not that smooth, I felt some jitter while scrolling fb, YouTube.
2. I saw frame drops a lot while playing 4k HDR videos in YouTube and 2 to 4 times the app even shuts down on its own.
3. If you are not a person, who likes to tinker around the settings, then you will be disturbed a lot with many notifications. I myself have to manually turned off so many notifications and permissions.
4. Yes, I know the processor is not that powerful, so I request you not to deal with more than 4 apps at a time, basically do it little slowly, otherwise you will feel some lag.
5. The call quality is very average, I mean the sound is very low, even in speaker mood, it feels like a normal call sound.

Now, coming to battery life and camera, this, I have not tested yet, so won't comment now, but from 100 to 69%, as of now I am getting 3.30 hrs of SOT, so let's see, I will update after first complete discharge.

This is regarding the battery back up, from 100% to 15%, I got around 10hrs of SOT, without playing games, mostly used fb, insta and lots of HDR and non HDR videos on YouTube, everything with 120hz on. This is after first time charging, now I am mainting 95-30% charging cycle, with this I will update after 1month. Photos are coming soon.

After one month update, I am still getting close to 7.30 to 8 hours of SOT, it hardly heats up, the only thing I encounter is, sometimes it feels laggy, this is probably due to ufs 2.2, rest everything is fine.

After the Android 15 based funtouch os 15 update, I am getting around 10.30 hrs of SOT, with variable screen refresh rate. This is not continuous test, rather, it's my normal day to day usage with 6 hours of sleep time at night. Animations are a bit smoother than previous versions.

The 8hrs 54 minutes screen on time (SOT) is after Android 15 update and 65% on 5g network and 35% on wifi. Jan 3, 2025.",Good phone value of money.,Good mobile,Very very smart phone so like it IQ z9s Mobail,"Ek khwahish thi ye curve display mobile lene ki...

After all that (15hrs of uses), the battery just drained to 25%, which is really good...
As for the camera, while it's not extraordinary, it’s still good for the price.

This was a lifesaver when I had limited access to power sources. The fast charging capability also saved me precious time, ensuring my devices were ready to go whenever I needed them.

4. Built-in Safety Features: Safety is always a concern when dealing with electronic devices, especially when traveling abroad. Fortunately, this travel adapter was equipped with reliable surge protection, overload protection, and short circuit prevention. I felt reassured knowing my devices were in safe hands.

Say goodbye to tangled wires and incompatible plugs; this travel adapter will keep you connected and powered up wherever your adventures take you. I highly recommend it to fellow globetrotters!

Happy travels!","A must for traveling abroad...
Best in that range👍🏼",Amazing purchase with a good price. a must have.,"I bought this product because I got a product which required australian port in India. When I bought it, I didn't started to use it immediately as I was away for 3 months. When I tried inserting in the plug, it didn't work because of the weight, it falls from the socket. I have to provide extra support to make sure that the plug is properly inserted in the socket.",I like the product and recommend however i saw the similar product in my local market at half of this price !,"It's compactness and weight are very well but the quality isn't that good

Even in USA the appliances that I had which supported 110-240V worked well, like macbook charger, philips trimmer charger etc. However some appliance like hair dryer which I had in India works only with the 240V. So I didn’t try using them as these adapters only provide physical adaptation and doesn’t do any voltage step up/step downs. And the usb port was nice.

B0B3MNYGTW,4.1,"I have been a user of OnePlus Bullets wireless earphones for almost 4-5 years now. The very first one I purchased was Bullets Z, then Bullets Z bass edition and Z2 twice. So, a total of 4 bullet series I have purchased as of now.
Regarding the life, it is really quite durable. The very first one I purchased still works really fine. The only thing is you will have to make sure it doesn't break. Until then, it will work really, really good.
Sound, look and everything is good for the price. If you want not very bass boosted sound like boat, this could be the perfect choice for you.

It supports fast charging and has good enough battery life.
Not the most you can expect in the market, but it has a good balance of all the things one might look for when buying a neckband.

Al last, it's the best for calls. Earbuds mics sucks when using it for calls. This will work great even when you will speak very quietly.

It doesn't have noise cancellation in the mics, so it will capture little background noise.
I hope this will help you.

I have attached my first 4.5-year-old neckband pic also, and I am still using it.","There is nothing wrong with the looks of the Bullets Z2, they are actually quite decent looking. They are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. The middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, U shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. The wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. One of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the USB Type C port on the side. You get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. The battery unit has the OnePlus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.

The earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. When the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. The Bullets Wireless Z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. The material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. It also comes with an IP55 rating.
Pairing the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. All you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. You can then look up the buds in the list of Bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. Once connected, the Bullets Z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.

You get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. Now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, OnePlus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. Apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), OnePlus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. You have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. It may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of OnePlus earphones- 12.4mm. The fact that OnePlus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. The earbuds support two audio codecs, SBC and AAC.

As for the audio performance, the Bullets Wireless Z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand’s audio formula in the budget segment. While this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.
If you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the Bullets Wireless Z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.

That said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. We could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. As the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.

They come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. But because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.
The Bullets Wireless Z2 also face some heat from the likes of Oppo Enco M32 and the Realme Buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are actually a great proposition for the price; you only need to have a liking for bass.","If you're on the lookout for a solid pair of wireless earphones, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 might just catch your eye. I've been using them for a while, and here's my honest take on what they have to offer.

Connectivity & Ease of Use:

Let’s start with one of the essentials—connectivity. The OnePlus Bullets Z2 nails it with seamless Bluetooth connectivity that just works. Pairing them with my phone was as simple as it gets, and once connected, they stay that way without any annoying drops. The button placement on the neckband is intuitive, and after a day or two of use, I could easily control playback without needing to glance down, thanks to muscle memory. It’s the kind of convenience you don’t realize you need until you have it.

Sound Quality - Balanced Yet Personal:

Now, onto the sound quality. As someone who values a balanced sound signature, I found the Z2 to be a great match for my taste. Whether I'm listening to some mellow jazz, electronic beats, or even rock, the sound remains well-rounded and crisp. The highs, mids, and lows don't overpower each other, making it perfect for those who don't want their ears blasted with bass or overwhelmed by treble.

That said, sound quality is a subjective experience, and preferences can vary widely. If you're a bass head looking for those earth-shaking lows, you might find these a tad restrained. But if, like me, you appreciate a balanced output across genres, these will hit the right notes for you.

Battery Life & Quick Charging - A Week of Peace:

Battery life is another highlight. With moderate use—think about 1-2 hours daily—you can stretch a single charge to last an entire week. Even if you’re a heavy listener, using them for 6-8 hours straight, they can hold up for around 2-3 days before needing a recharge. And the quick charge feature is a lifesaver—just 10 minutes of charging gets you 2-4 hours of extra playtime, which is perfect for those “oops, I forgot to charge them” moments.

Gaming & Low Latency - Smooth Experience:

I spend a fair bit of time playing games like BGMI, and the low latency mode on the Bullets Z2 makes a noticeable difference. There's minimal lag between the visuals and the audio, which makes for a much more immersive gaming experience. It's not just about the sound being clear; it's also about it being on time, and these earphones deliver that pretty well.

Comfort & Passive Noise Isolation:

Comfort is key when it comes to neckbands, and the Z2 doesn’t disappoint. They come with multiple earbud sizes, so you can pick the one that fits snugly for you. While there’s no active noise cancellation (ANC) here, you can achieve a decent level of passive noise isolation by choosing the right ear tips. This makes a noticeable difference in cutting out background noise during commutes or at the office.

App Experience & Annoying Blinking Light:

Now, onto a couple of quirks. The Bullets Z2 uses the HeyMelody app, which offers additional features like custom sound settings. However, my unit just wouldn’t connect with the app, which was a bummer. So, any fancy tweaks you could make through the app were out of my reach, and I had to rely solely on the default Bluetooth pairing. While everything worked smoothly once connected, I feel like I missed out on some customization options that might have enhanced my experience.

Another thing that bugged me was the small white light that blinks when the neckband is connected to a device. It might not seem like a big deal, but if you’re using the earphones in a dark room or while lying down, that blinking light can be pretty distracting. Plus, it probably drains the battery a bit, albeit a small amount. A simple option to turn this off in the app would’ve been a nice touch.

Final Thoughts - A Solid Pick for Most, with Room for Improvement:

Overall, the OnePlus Z2 delivers where it matters—good sound quality, reliable connectivity, and battery life that won’t have you constantly reaching for the charger. It’s not perfect, especially with the blinking light and app connectivity issues, but those are minor compared to the solid performance it offers. Plus, with the quick-charge feature and low-latency gaming experience, it’s hard not to appreciate the value you get.

If you’re looking for a reliable neckband that blends style, comfort, and balanced audio, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 is definitely worth considering. It might not satisfy those who crave earth-shattering bass, but for most listeners, it's a worthy contender at its price point.","Bought it over a year ago and still works great. The highs and lows are great for a headphone of this cost. Podcast and audible, TEDX listening is also great. Conferencing over PCs is also a breeze. I have 8 headphones with blue tooth but this gives no interference and works stable. GREAT blue tooth range, has problems when you are in 2nd floor and your device is in 1st or ground floor.

This product get so many checkboxes right, while it is not the BEST audio headphone for songs or movies but the ANC feature gets you immersive sound, this also helps a lot when attending calls. There is a slight discomfort for fitting into the ears but with adjusting it this would be fine, This is not a headphone that you can sleep with.
Charging is a little bit slow but that 5-10 mins extra should not be a problem. It easily charges up for almost 80% in 20 mins and comes for 2-2.5 days for a person like who uses it for 6 hours straight everyday. This is not the type of earphone for bikers or during biking though the sound is great but this gets super uncomfortable with helmet on.
These earbuds are highly functional. Though earphones like bose give better sound quality but die on you faster either losing charge or break due to higher maintenance.
This is also a great headphones for gym but it depends how you fix it into your ear as it may fallout of place often. It somehow is greatly sweat resistant and can be used in tougher scenarios.
The loudness is apt. There are 2 or atleast one firmware updates you will get.and once you are version 11.3 you are good to go.
It does not work with some tablets especially with xiaomi pad 6, it could also be a failure from the tablets side. Works well with laptops: tested on windows, mac and ubuntu, fedora linux systems. Also tested with HP ASUS MSI, did not test with lenovo and dell.
The only better buds I found that are as functional as these is the realme wireless buds 3 as it seems to connect with every device. There is usually no reason to avoid this if you enjoy listening to metal or operatic music or jazz or soul or RnB and great for hindustani and carnatic music. Above average for gaming sounds, please avoid if you are chatting over a online game like dota, valorant, fortnite. But for me it worked great on league of legends, acceptable in cs:go, battlefield and I noticed that it works better for PC games rather than extended mobile games. Otherwise it is a great functional headphone. With magnetic shut off you have to careful that if you remove it out for anything it would disconnect.

In my case it works well as a all rounder except for some tabs, I had no problem wih iPad, one plus and realme tabs --- DOES NOT WORK ON XIAOMI TAB 6 BUT FINE WITH REDMI TAB, DID NOT TEST FOR LENOVO AND SAMSUNG.
If you want a pure TWS use the one plus buds 2r, but the sound quality of this headphone is a notch better though.

Please only avoid these earphones if you have a short neck or heavily fat from double chinas the wires cause interference and fall off often even if the grip is good.","I recently purchased the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC Bluetooth in-ear earphones, and I'm really impressed with their performance. The 45dB Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation works wonders in blocking out external noise, which makes the listening experience immersive, whether I'm traveling or just relaxing at home.

The sound quality is top-notch with the 12.4 mm drivers providing rich, clear, and booming bass. It's perfect for all kinds of music genres, from bass-heavy tracks to vocals and instrumental tunes.

What I really appreciate is the fast charging feature – just 10 minutes of charging gives me 20 hours of music playback, which is incredible for daily use. The battery life of up to 28 hours is also impressive, making it perfect for long trips or workdays.

The design is sleek and comfortable, fitting snugly in the ears without feeling heavy or uncomfortable, even after hours of use. The mic works well for calls, and the Bluetooth connectivity is stable with minimal interruptions.

Overall, the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC earphones offer great value for the price. If you're looking for a pair of earphones with amazing sound quality, comfort, and solid battery life, I highly recommend them!","The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is the latest addition to OnePlus' lineup of wireless earphones, offering significant upgrades over its predecessors. These in-ear Bluetooth earphones feature Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) up to 45dB, bombastic bass driven by 12.4mm drivers, and a long-lasting battery life, all packed into an ergonomic design. With just 10 minutes of charging, you get up to 20 hours of music playback, making it an excellent choice for those who need a reliable and powerful audio device on the go. The product is available in the striking ""Grand Green"" color, adding a touch of style to its functional design.

### Design and Build Quality

The design of the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC reflects a balance between aesthetics and practicality. The ""Grand Green"" color gives it a unique, vibrant look that stands out without being overly flashy. The earphones are constructed from high-quality materials, ensuring durability while maintaining a lightweight profile.

**Neckband Design:**
The neckband design is both flexible and sturdy, making it comfortable for long-term wear. The earphones are designed to fit snugly in the ears, which is crucial for effective noise cancellation and bass response. The magnetic earbuds are a convenient feature, allowing the earphones to snap together when not in use, which prevents tangling and conserves battery by automatically pausing playback.

**Ergonomics:**
Ergonomics play a key role in the overall user experience of these earphones. The earbuds are designed to fit comfortably in the ear canal, providing a secure fit that helps to block out external noise even when the ANC is turned off. The lightweight neckband rests comfortably on the shoulders without causing discomfort, making these earphones suitable for extended use.

**Build Quality:**
The build quality of the Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is commendable. The materials used feel premium, and the buttons on the neckband are tactile and responsive. The device is also IP55-rated, meaning it is resistant to dust and water splashes, making it suitable for workouts and outdoor use.

### Sound Quality

One of the standout features of the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is its sound quality, particularly the bass. The 12.4mm dynamic drivers are larger than what is typically found in wireless earphones, and this translates to a rich, deep bass response that is ideal for bass-heavy genres like EDM, hip-hop, and pop.

**Bass Response:**
The bass on these earphones is described as ""bombastic,"" and rightly so. The 12.4mm drivers deliver a powerful low-end that doesn’t overshadow the mids and highs but rather complements them. The bass is punchy and clear, providing a satisfying thump that many users will appreciate, especially during workouts or while commuting.

**Mid and High Frequencies:**
The midrange is well-represented, with vocals and instruments coming through clearly without being drowned out by the bass. The highs are crisp and detailed, offering a balanced sound signature that is versatile enough for various music genres. However, some audiophiles might find the emphasis on bass slightly overpowering for more acoustic or classical tracks.

**Active Noise Cancellation:**
The Hybrid ANC technology in the Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is capable of reducing ambient noise by up to 45dB. This feature works exceptionally well in environments with consistent background noise, such as on public transport or in a busy office. The ANC feature not only enhances the listening experience by minimizing distractions but also allows for lower volume levels, which can help in reducing ear fatigue over time.

### Battery Life

Battery life is another area where the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC excels. The earphones offer up to 28 hours of total battery life on a full charge, which is more than sufficient for daily use. This endurance makes them ideal for long commutes, travel, or extended use throughout the day.

**Fast Charging:**
One of the most impressive aspects of these earphones is their fast charging capability. With just 10 minutes of charging, you can get up to 20 hours of playback time. This feature is particularly useful for those who are often on the move and need a quick top-up before heading out. The full charge time is also relatively short, allowing the earphones to be fully charged in less than an hour.

**Usage with ANC:**
When using ANC, the battery life is understandably reduced, but it still remains impressive. With ANC turned on, you can expect around 18 to 20 hours of playback, which is still above average compared to other wireless earphones in the market. The battery life makes these earphones highly reliable, reducing the need for frequent recharges.

### Connectivity and Controls

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC offers seamless connectivity with Bluetooth 5.0, ensuring a stable connection with minimal latency. The earphones are easy to pair with both Android and iOS devices, although they work particularly well with OnePlus smartphones, which can unlock additional features like quick pairing and battery status notifications.

**Latency:**
For those who enjoy gaming or watching videos on their mobile devices, low latency is a crucial factor. The Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC performs well in this regard, with minimal lag that ensures audio syncs well with video content. This makes them suitable not just for music but also for multimedia consumption.

**Controls:**
The inline controls on the neckband are intuitive and easy to use. The buttons allow for controlling playback, adjusting volume, taking calls, and activating voice assistants. The buttons are well-placed and provide good feedback, making it easy to use the controls without needing to look at them. The earphones also support quick switching between two paired devices, a handy feature for those who frequently switch between their phone and laptop.

**Call Quality:**
The Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC features a built-in microphone that provides clear voice transmission during calls. The noise cancellation technology also extends to call quality, effectively reducing background noise so that your voice comes through clearly even in noisy environments. This makes the earphones suitable for professional use, such as conference calls or virtual meetings.

### Additional Features

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC comes with several additional features that enhance the overall user experience:

**Environmental Noise Cancellation (ENC):**
While ANC helps block out external noise during music playback, the Environmental Noise Cancellation (ENC) technology focuses on improving call quality by reducing background noise during calls. This ensures that your voice is heard clearly on the other end, even in noisy environments.

**Magnetic Control:**
The magnetic control feature automatically pauses music playback when the earbuds are snapped together and resumes when they are separated. This not only helps conserve battery life but also adds convenience, especially when you need to quickly pause and resume your music.

**Voice Assistant Support:**
The earphones support voice assistants like Google Assistant and Siri, allowing for hands-free control of your device. This is particularly useful when you need to make a call, send a message, or get directions without reaching for your phone.

### Comfort and Fit

Comfort is a crucial aspect of any in-ear earphones, and the Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC scores well in this department. The earphones come with multiple sizes of silicone ear tips, ensuring a secure and comfortable fit for different ear shapes. The snug fit also helps with passive noise isolation, further enhancing the effectiveness of the ANC feature.

**Weight and Wearability:**
The earphones are lightweight, making them comfortable to wear for extended periods without causing ear fatigue. The neckband design distributes the weight evenly across the shoulders, preventing the earphones from feeling heavy or cumbersome.

**Suitability for Sports and Workouts:**
Thanks to the IP55 rating, the Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is resistant to sweat and water, making them suitable for workouts and outdoor activities. The secure fit ensures that the earphones stay in place during physical activity, providing a reliable audio experience even during intense exercise.

### Price and Value for Money

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is priced competitively, offering excellent value for money given its feature set. It is positioned in the mid-range segment, making it accessible to a wide range of users while still providing premium features such as Hybrid ANC, powerful bass, and long battery life.

**Comparison with Competitors:**
When compared to other wireless earphones in the same price range, the Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC holds its own, if not outperforms, many competitors. The combination of sound quality, build, and features like fast charging and ANC make it a strong contender in the market. Competitors like the Realme Buds Wireless and JBL Tune series offer similar features, but the overall package of the Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is more refined, especially in terms of bass performance and battery life.

**Long-Term Value:**
Considering the durability, battery life, and sound quality, the Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC represents a long-term investment. The earphones are built to last, and the feature set ensures that they will continue to meet your needs even as your usage patterns evolve.

They are particularly well-suited for users who enjoy bass-heavy music genres and need a reliable pair of earphones for daily use.

- **Comfortable and Secure Fit:** Ergonomically designed for extended use, with IP55 rating","I recently purchased your headphone, but I am not satisfied with its performance. The sound clarity is not good while riding a bike, and at times, the sound cuts off automatically. These issues are affecting the overall experience, and I am quite disappointed with the product.

I request you to kindly look into the matter and provide a solution or replacement if possible.

Looking forward to your prompt response.","Good sound quality and durable built. However, the wire connecting earbuds quality is degraded over time - little thinner and less flexible compared to earlier sent same models. May be cost compromised.","The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC deliver solid sound with deep bass and surprisingly good noise cancellation for the price. Very comfortable to wear, and the battery life is amazing — easily lasts over 20 hours with ANC on, and fast charging is a lifesaver.

Call quality is decent, and the magnetic controls are a nice touch. Wish it had multipoint connection and an app for EQ, but overall, it's a great buy under ₹2,000. Perfect for music, calls, and daily use.

✅ Pros:

Powerful bass

Good ANC

Long battery life

Fast charging

Comfortable & durable

❌ Cons:

No multipoint pairing

Definitely recommended if you're on a budget and want solid ANC!","Really nice for the price. Sounds great, the ANC is better than expected and quite comfortable. My only negative may actually be your positive so take it as u want.. there is no off button. The ear pieces stick together with magnets automatically disconnecting the device. While that may sound convenient, if they get separated while stuffing the headset into your bag, your phone may stay connected draining the battery of the headset and making u unable to answer any calls.","OnePlus Bullets Z2 – My Take
Sound’s solid, bass hits nice.
Battery? Lasts forever!
Charges super quick too.
Feels light on the neck, no pain.
No fancy noise canceling, but works fine.

**Purchased on:** 29th September 2024

**Pros:**

1. **Impressive Bluetooth Range:** Thanks to Bluetooth 5.3, I experience clear audio with minimal distortion on both my phone and laptop, even when I'm in another room.
2. **Enhanced Audio Quality with AAC Codec:** The inclusion of the AAC codec noticeably improves audio clarity.
3. **Effective Active Noise Cancellation (ANC):** This feature performs exceptionally well, effectively reducing background noise even in crowded spaces like carnivals or the gym.
4. **Clear Microphone Quality:** The mic quality is excellent; I’m consistently heard loud and clear on calls.
5. **Useful Transparency Mode:** Allows you to remain aware of your surroundings—great for safety when biking.
6. **Quick Charge Feature:** Battery reaches full charge in just 15-20 minutes, making it super convenient.
7. **Seamless Device Switching:** The function button quickly swaps between last-paired devices and reconnects automatically.
8. **Google Fast Pair Support:** For easy pairing with compatible devices.
9. **Sturdy Build:** The neckband and cables feel durable, though I'd recommend handling with care.
10. **Secure Fit:** Stays put in the ears without slipping out.

**Cons:**

1. **Frequent Disconnection on Windows:** There's a consistent disconnecting issue when paired with a Windows laptop, which doesn’t happen on other devices. This may not be a concern if it’s used exclusively on the laptop.
2. **Volume Limitation:** Despite the 12.4mm drivers, the sound feels slightly low, requiring a 50%+ volume level.
3. **Occasional Call Connection Issues:** Sometimes, the phone defaults to its own earpiece instead of the neckband during calls.
4. **Battery Life Falls Short:** With ANC, I get about 6-7 hours of playback, and around 15 hours with ANC off, which doesn’t meet the 20-hour claim by OnePlus.
5. **Comfort Issues at First:** The earbuds felt a bit uncomfortable during initial use, but this improved slightly after a month. However, if my ears are moist, they still can feel a bit stingy.
6. **Bass Might Disappoint Bass Lovers:** Bass isn’t as pronounced, though mids and trebles are well-balanced.
7. **No Dual Device Pairing:** Limits multitasking with multiple devices.

While the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC is a decent buy under ₹1,800, I wouldn't recommend it at a higher price point. There are other options worth considering if you’re willing to explore!","I recently got my hands on the OnePlus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless Earphones, and I have to say, they’ve made a significant impression on me. Here’s my take on the pros and cons based on my experience.

Pros:
Bombastic Bass: The 12.4 mm drivers deliver incredible bass that really enhances my listening experience. Whether I'm jamming to music or watching movies, the sound quality is truly impressive.

Comfortable Fit: These earphones come with different ear tip sizes, allowing me to find the perfect fit. They sit snugly in my ears, making them comfortable for extended use.

Good Battery Life: I appreciate the battery performance; they last for hours on a single charge, so I can enjoy my music throughout the day without constantly worrying about recharging.

Clear Microphone Quality: The built-in microphone does a great job during calls. I’ve received positive feedback from friends and family about how clear I sound, even in noisy environments.

Fast Charging: The fast charging feature is a lifesaver. A quick charge provides several hours of playback, which is perfect when I’m in a rush.

Cons:
Limited Controls: The controls are somewhat basic. While they allow for play/pause and volume adjustments, I wish they had more options for customizing sound settings directly.

No Active Noise Cancellation: Although the sound quality is great, the absence of active noise cancellation means that background noise can be noticeable, which can be distracting in loud settings.

Wired Design: As a neckband style, the cable can sometimes get in the way during activities, like exercising. I prefer fully wireless options for a more seamless experience.

Build Quality: While they feel decent, I did notice that the build quality could be a bit sturdier. I’m a bit concerned about how they’ll hold up over time with regular use.

Conclusion
Overall, I’m quite satisfied with the OnePlus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless Earphones. The bombastic bass, comfortable fit, and solid battery life make them a great choice for music lovers like me. While there are a few drawbacks, such as limited controls and no active noise cancellation, they don’t detract significantly from the overall experience. If you're looking for affordable earphones that deliver impressive sound quality, I definitely recommend giving these a try!","Phone pass me thaa - Bluetooth connect thaa

Go for this mobile if you are thinking for elderly person.",Normal,Overall it is good.,Mst phone hai,"1. The claim that the camera quality is 50 megapixels is FAR from the truth. To test it, I compared it with Realme C12, a 7-year-old 13-megapixel phone. Except for the color grading of the pixel, nothing really has changed! There is NO benefit of any resolution here. It is pretty clear that the 50-megapixel reported camera value by the company doesn't correspond to the actual hardware.

2. The battery and charging are the BIGGEST downside of the phone! The claim that the battery has around 5000+ mAh doesn't seem to be true. It is FAR inferior to my Realme C12 which reports 6000+ mAh battery. Charging doesn't work when the phone is switched on with a portable hotspot, data and GPS are on! So once switched off, the charging works well corresponding to a fast charger up to 90% of the battery charge status, after which it slows down and gets severely struck at 95% charging status. The last 5% take more than 15-20 mins!

3. Sound Quality is pretty normal and ordinary compared to any other phone.

4. The phone actually weighs more and is not as portable as my old 7.5k Realme C12. The camera design is pretty lame and has no performance benefit over Realme C12 in comparison. The circular extension at the back actually makes it difficult to hold a bit. The cameras are far more ordinary with just better color grading.

5. It doesn't support Airtel 5G as Manufacturers admit.

6. The memory capacity RAM is 4G, which is 1G improvement over Realme C12. But for an ordinary user with 4-5 years of use, this shouldn't affect him much, unless gaming or other performance extensive use.",Good,Good product at Competitive Price.. Good specifications..

2nd ly it's reglfresh rate also slow.

Others things are still looks ok.",PHONE IS GOOD BUT SOFT WARE IS NOT WORKING PROPERELY FROM FIRST DAY,"✅Comes with default Xiomi dialer so call recording feature is a huge plus point. One may never know when it's needed.

✅Bigger screen size: This has its own advantage and disadvantage. Good to use for elders when font size is increased on a already bigger screen size phone. Safe hand to eye distance can be easily achieved.
❌Issue is that bigger size bigger battery makes it bulky (keep in mind back cover will also add overall weight slightly). One hand use is risky because handling might become difficult for few people.

✅Battery backup: Not sure how much Xiomi has worked on battery backup but so far it's looking decent hopefully it stays this way in future as well. (Only other Redmi phone I used was their debut model in India 'Redmi 1S' that was launched way back 10 years ago and it wasn't so good on battery backup)

✅Updates: Received first update (security patch) today as I write this review.

✅ Charging speed is definitely good.

❌Storage: custom UI phones lack in this. Unnecessary apps, tweaks and customisation eat up system space. I've literally kept this phone as received it 2 weeks ago. No data saved so far and already 23 GB system space is full. 128 internal space in budget segment phones should now be default given size of apps and never ending updates.

🤷🏽Can't comment on 5G since I don't have jio connection. 4G is working fine.
❌Separate budget for screen protector and back cover.

Compact & Lightweight: Easy to carry, making it great for travel.

The quality is good, and I like the simple design. I chose the white color because it matches the cable, but the charger isn’t wrapped in plastic, so it might get dirty or look dull over time.

Some find this mobile huge.
This has inbuilt call recording.

Go for this mobile if you are thinking for elderly person.",Normal,Overall it is good.,Mst phone hai,"1. The claim that the camera quality is 50 megapixels is FAR from the truth. To test it, I compared it with Realme C12, a 7-year-old 13-megapixel phone. Except for the color grading of the pixel, nothing really has changed! There is NO benefit of any resolution here. It is pretty clear that the 50-megapixel reported camera value by the company doesn't correspond to the actual hardware.

2. The battery and charging are the BIGGEST downside of the phone! The claim that the battery has around 5000+ mAh doesn't seem to be true. It is FAR inferior to my Realme C12 which reports 6000+ mAh battery. Charging doesn't work when the phone is switched on with a portable hotspot, data and GPS are on! So once switched off, the charging works well corresponding to a fast charger up to 90% of the battery charge status, after which it slows down and gets severely struck at 95% charging status. The last 5% take more than 15-20 mins!

3. Sound Quality is pretty normal and ordinary compared to any other phone.

4. The phone actually weighs more and is not as portable as my old 7.5k Realme C12. The camera design is pretty lame and has no performance benefit over Realme C12 in comparison. The circular extension at the back actually makes it difficult to hold a bit. The cameras are far more ordinary with just better color grading.

5. It doesn't support Airtel 5G as Manufacturers admit.

6. The memory capacity RAM is 4G, which is 1G improvement over Realme C12. But for an ordinary user with 4-5 years of use, this shouldn't affect him much, unless gaming or other performance extensive use.",Good,Good product at Competitive Price.. Good specifications..

2nd ly it's reglfresh rate also slow.

Others things are still looks ok.",PHONE IS GOOD BUT SOFT WARE IS NOT WORKING PROPERELY FROM FIRST DAY,"✅Comes with default Xiomi dialer so call recording feature is a huge plus point. One may never know when it's needed.

✅Bigger screen size: This has its own advantage and disadvantage. Good to use for elders when font size is increased on a already bigger screen size phone. Safe hand to eye distance can be easily achieved.
❌Issue is that bigger size bigger battery makes it bulky (keep in mind back cover will also add overall weight slightly). One hand use is risky because handling might become difficult for few people.

✅Battery backup: Not sure how much Xiomi has worked on battery backup but so far it's looking decent hopefully it stays this way in future as well. (Only other Redmi phone I used was their debut model in India 'Redmi 1S' that was launched way back 10 years ago and it wasn't so good on battery backup)

✅Updates: Received first update (security patch) today as I write this review.

✅ Charging speed is definitely good.

❌Storage: custom UI phones lack in this. Unnecessary apps, tweaks and customisation eat up system space. I've literally kept this phone as received it 2 weeks ago. No data saved so far and already 23 GB system space is full. 128 internal space in budget segment phones should now be default given size of apps and never ending updates.

🤷🏽Can't comment on 5G since I don't have jio connection. 4G is working fine.
❌Separate budget for screen protector and back cover.

B0BG8LZNYL,4.2,"Very good product, nice quality, premium feel, excellent features like ability to connect via wireless usb 2.4 and bluetooth, nice rgb lighting. Overall great value for money.","Product delivered on time.
Easy to attach with My laptop, hassle-free operation. Battery life is good, most amazing feature is side buttons. Ambience lights are a good feel factor
Nice product in this price range","Best mouse I have used under 1000 rupees. U can change dpi and it's perfect fit for your hand. Doesn't hurt your wrist. Connects instantly through dongle, no lag","It's ideal for the budget, i was worried if it would be too small for my big hands. But it's not too small. RGB lights gave up after 2 months but it works really well which was my priority.so overall a good but.","I would have rated this 5/5, because of it's looks and price. However, 1 deducted for two reasons.
First, the pros:
1. The lights are absolutely beautiful. They keep changing and merging, lighting up the mouse and the logo.
2. Color is good.
3. Built is very strong.
4. Connection us fast.
5. Extremely sensitive to touch, still precise.

The cons:
1. Battery backup is not good, compared to other mouse at the same price range,
2. There is no battery level indicator, which many others provide at the same price.
3. Size a bit bulky. I would not recommend this to people with small hands.

Overall, seems to be good at this price range.

Tip: Go for the black color, it is definitely better than white and looks more elegant.","I am extremely satisfied with its performance. The build quality is excellent, and it feels sturdy in hand. The connectivity is seamless, making it easy to pair with my devices. The mouse is highly responsive and works smoothly on various surfaces, providing a great user experience.","It is a good fun product specially for the price I got it. (During festive season). The battery lasts for like a week with the RGB on when ever in use. Very smooth and most important it has a good ergonomics.
The side two buttons to go back and forward are really helpful.
If one thing I wish it had was a feature to check the percent of battery remaining. Even in small ear buds you have the feature where it shows the current charge percent when connected, but this does not. So basically you have to wait for it to blink warning sign. (Which might be difficult to notice if you are always keeping it in RGB mode) And once it starts blinking it lasts for like 10-15 mins. So if you forgot to have the charging wire with you, you cannot use it. But good thing is, it also charges with you phone charger (Type C Charger)","I bought this mouse on March 20, 2025 for Rs. 549, this product is more than value for money.
I haven't charge it even a single time since it was delivered and as of April 06, 2025, the remaining battery life is 26% (after moderate use of 5-7 hours daily with RGB Light off), I just plugged in charging just to check whether charging is working or not when it was delivered, so it has unbelievable battery life, but it doesn't come with any battery life indication, you have to connect it with Bluetooth to check the battery status.
Clicks are soft and don't make that much noise, scroll wheel has a rubber padding or ring on it that feels very premium and comfortable to use,
You can customize those extra buttons on side ( I personally use a software called ""X Mouse Button"" to customize these buttons)
It connects to the USB Receiver and Bluetooth in No Time, I personally use it with the Receiver and there is no lag (not really sure about Gaming Latency or Lag because I use it for normal usage)
Build Quality is decent, not so Premium and not so Cheap Plastic, it is good, specifically the Price Point it comes at.","Good Mouse, still using the mouse to click this review. When u turn on the rgb, the battery is limited to few hours and If turned off you get around 5-6 days of battery use in dongle and Bluetooth mixed use. The DPI in this is solid. The additional keys could be mapped with external software, but not portronics software. Doesn't have wired mode at all, so even if u want to use the mouse you can still charge and connect to a dongle or bluetooth. Overall Feels good Quality.","Bohot hee bhadiya, Bluetooth connection and durability - have been using for more than 2 years.
One star less for scroll wheel - because that is only good with costly mouse but still at this price it is a good gadget to have for work.","Worth the price
-Comes with a donle
-Has RGB ( can be turned off )
-Buttons are nice
-Scroll wheel has rubber grip
-Side buttons work nicely",This mouse is bluetooth only. No usb dongle,Good mouse and nice work,Good product,Good build quality is weak but for the price its justified,Its good. Can go for it.,"The product features and Bluetooth connectivity with multiple devices is good. RGB colour can be turned off.
Cons:
The multi device connect switch is placed at the bottom which is annoying sometimes when you try to switch devices.
The mouse click sound is not silent so can’t use when kids are sleeping.","Very comfortable to hold, battery backup is very good.",Easy to use,Nice product,Good one,It's good for this price.,"Portronics Toad 1 Wireless Rechargeable Mouse
The Portronics Toad 1 Wireless Rechargeable Mouse is an excellent choice for those looking for a stylish and feature-rich mouse at an affordable price. Here's a breakdown of its pros and cons:

Pros:
1. Great Design: The sleek and modern design adds a premium touch to your workspace, making it visually appealing.
2. RGB Lighting: The customizable RGB lighting enhances its aesthetic appeal and gives it a gamer-friendly vibe.
3. Great Connectivity: The mouse ensures seamless and lag-free performance, thanks to its reliable connectivity.
4. Comfortable Feel: Its ergonomic design provides an excellent in-hand feel, making it ideal for extended usage without causing discomfort.
5. 3-Way Connection: With support for a 2.4GHz receiver and two Bluetooth connections, this mouse can easily switch between devices, making it highly versatile and convenient.

Cons:
1. Battery Life: While the rechargeable battery is convenient, it lasts only 2 to 3 weeks with RGB lighting turned on. With the RGB off, the battery life improves but still caps at 4 to 5 weeks.

Verdict:
The Portronics Toad 1 is a fantastic wireless mouse for its price, offering style, comfort, and advanced connectivity options. However, frequent charging might be a slight drawback for some users. If you can manage the battery aspect, this is a solid pick!","Easy to use and connect.
Value for the money
And build quality is good",It s a good mouse.with good features perfect for browseing.,"Overall it's a good buy but sadly I lost my dongle and it's been pathetic since that , for bluetooth connectivity you have to manually connect with bluetooth section of pc and every time you open your pc it's a new device everytime and have to try 4-5 times atleast to connect via bt , only recommend for use via dongle , battery is good but there's no way to know how much percentage it is charged , cable for charging is too short , the side keys doesn't seem to work everytime it 2/3 times , go for any normal mouse at this price point if you don't have any appetite for some fancy rgb gaming mouse","""Accha hai dpi bhi sahi hai,"" NEW REVIEW :- 7 feb ko mene purchase kiya tha ye or aaj 27 feb hai lekin iska charjing discharge nhi hua abhi tak, or maine jab se liya hai tabse mouse ko off nhi kiya hai . pc band karne k baad b mouse on hi rakha rehta hai lekin 20 dino me charjing khatam nhi hua hai, single time charje kiya hu 7feb ko hi tab se chal raha hai mast ekdam. mai bas rgb off rakha hai..",Really good mouse worth for the price as well as very good battery backup,Nice product used it for more then 2 months,Best mouse under 1000,"Good,
But very jumbo",Just got my product i connected with my laptop and it was easy to connect it. Product seems to be Good rest will know More once i start using properly. At this price range it's a good product 👍,"All okay with given budget. I don't have intention to give bad feedback as well with 3 star. My only struggle with this mouse is, it goes to sleep mode toooooooooo quick which is hell the reason why ik forcing to write this feedback. Every damn single time i have to hold thr mouse upside down to switch off/swiff off to wake up thr mouse from sleep mode. Saving the battery by pushing it to sleep mode is absolutely acceptable, but tooooooooooooo damn short time. Should have at least 5min non usage also acceptable. Im sorry makers, please consider this genuine struggle and suggestion.","One of the best mouse for gaming, I had used till now 👍","Not compatible with mac properly. Working slow in mac, you can go for windows machine. Charging seems an issue, not long lasting as expected.","This is the first mouse I own which has rechargeable batteries built in. At a stretch, it works for 4-5 days with moderate use before it needs charging again. As per the instructions when you are charging, it should glow blue and become green when full. But in reality, the RGB lights keep changing so you won't be able to find out if it is fully charged or not. I switch to bluetooth mode to check battery % on my laptop, and that gives an idea. But I wish there was a proper system in place for this. Another thing is that it does not give any notification for low battery, so it just shuts right off.

Also, I have noticed the 2 bluetooth modes provided in the mouse do work, but sometimes if your computer is under heavy load then the cursor stutters. So, the default receiver mode is what I end up using all the time. This mouse can be used while it is being charged as well, so that thing is a big PRO for me. The downside is that the charging cable provided with the mouse is extremely small, so I ended up using the phone charging cable to charge the mouse.","the mouse is good for 549 inr, but charge is the main issue (lasts <10 hours with rgb)","Great product with best wireless connection, great gaming experience with great performance, very easy to use both in bluetooth and dongle mode","I recently purchased this mouse, and I must say I am highly impressed with its performance. The features it offers at this price point are outstanding, making it a great value for money. It works flawlessly, providing a very good overall experience. However, I feel the battery life could be improved to make it even better. Despite that, I am extremely satisfied with the product and would definitely recommend it.","Jittery and irregular scrolling after nearly 1 year of use.
Scrolling does not feel smooth at all. It often jumps up and down. The clicks are also sometimes buggy, like it clicks two times when clicked for just one time.
It might be the sensor issue and it feels really frustrating.","The mouse has been a great addition to my setup! It offers versatile connectivity, a comfortable design, and a cool RGB lighting effect, making it ideal for work and entertainment. Here’s my take on its performance after a few weeks of use:

Pros:
Dual Wireless Connectivity: The 2.4 GHz wireless and Bluetooth 5.3 dual-mode is super convenient! I can connect it to my laptop, tablet, and smartphone, all at the same time, and switch seamlessly between devices.
Rechargeable Battery: Love the rechargeable feature—it’s eco-friendly and saves money on disposable batteries. Plus, it lasts a good while on a single charge.
6 Buttons for Extra Functionality: The additional buttons make it easy to customize shortcuts, especially for productivity or light gaming. It’s handy if you need quick access to commands.
RGB Lighting: The RGB lights add a cool touch without being too flashy. They can be turned off if you prefer a cleaner look or want to save battery.
Ergonomic Design: The mouse feels very comfortable in hand, even after long hours of use. It’s lightweight and well-shaped, making it easy to grip.

Cons:
Battery Indicator Missing: There’s no way to tell when the battery is low until it suddenly runs out. An indicator or low-battery notification would be helpful.
Limited RGB Customization: While the RGB lighting is nice, there aren’t many options to customize colours or patterns.
Average Performance for Gaming: While it's fine for everyday use and light gaming, serious gamers might find the DPI and response time a bit lacking(use 2.4ghz for gaming, better response).

Overall:
This mouse is a fantastic value if you’re looking for a multi-device, dual-mode, rechargeable mouse that’s comfortable and stylish. It’s perfect for work, browsing, and light gaming, and the RGB lights add a nice touch. Just be mindful of the lack of battery indicator, and you’re all set!","Good things that I really like about this mouse:
1. Matte finish, feels really nice to hold, enough for my hand's size.
2. Mouse buttons feels really nice, and the side buttons don't feel like gimmick unlike few other mouses I've tried.
3. Plug and play.
4. Battery lasts around 7+ days without RGB on. (8 hours usage per day on average)
5. Bluetooth latency less.
Now things I don't like:
1. It's on a bit heavier side, compared to a wired mouse I got.
2. When you use it with its given dongle, latency is noticable, which is not present with bluetooth.
3. Lasts like around 12 hours+ smth with RGB on.

But honestly at this range, it's pretty good and value for money.",great for the budget,"It sounds like you've had a pretty solid experience with your mouse over the past 1.5 years, especially i am a field officer daily using different location, The Quality was really good! Battery life of 20 to 25 days per charge is impressive, Every day am using minimum 7 to 8 hr, and it’s great that it’s been working reliably for that long,If it's still performing well in terms of connectivity and sensing, it seems like it’s been a good.","Been using this since Oct, 2024 an amazing product, has an nice battery life lasts around a week or 2, will recommend ans it is wireless, no need of wired tangle.","Its charging port does not fit and work all usb type-c cables as it has an outward angled. It does not even fit portronics own cable. It works well with mac os. Personally i have found it more userfull than the apple mouse on macbook with external monitor. It does ergonomics issue. It does not have zoom option like mac mouse so more usefull when using external monitor with macbook, rather than mac mini.",I think I bought this item 4days back and this has been amazing mouse for me the lights are good the quality of plastic is good it feels comfortable and it has good tech too but I think while I m gaming it fast speed the scrool of mouse skips 1-2 bit of response so u should check that otherwise it's all good and I haven't charged the mouse since 4 days I use it like daily 4 hours so ya.. adding 50 rs more for colour I don't think it's necessary u can buy black mouse..btw I m happy with my white colour bcz I game😁,Good quality product at this price very simple contact multiple devices but only one thing its can't connect iphone rest android teb mobile and pc connect,"great product for under 600rs with BT 5.3, DPI 1600 and RGB Light","Very good mouse in its price range, I will charge it once in every 3 days and my use of mouse is very.

Good quality.,"I recently purchased a ream of JK Copier Paper with the specifications A4 size and 75 GSM weight, and I must admit that my experience with this product has been less than satisfactory. Here's what I've observed:

GSM Accuracy Concerns: The most concerning issue is that the paper does not appear to be genuine 75 GSM. It feels noticeably thinner and softer than expected, which is disappointing. This discrepancy can affect the overall quality of printouts and may not meet the requirements of professional or high-quality documents.

Wrinkled Sheets: I found that a significant number of sheets in the ream were wrinkled. This not only affects the aesthetics of printed documents but also raises concerns about the overall quality control of this product.

Printer Jams: Another issue I encountered is that this paper tends to jam the printer occasionally. Such printer jams can be frustrating, time-consuming, and may even lead to damage to the printer over time.

In summary, my experience with JK Copier Paper A4, 75 GSM, has been far from ideal. The paper does not seem to meet the claimed GSM rating, is prone to wrinkles, and occasionally causes printer jams. If you require reliable and consistent paper quality for important printing tasks, I would recommend exploring other paper brands that offer more dependable performance.","For 🖨, xerox nd for project work",Opened unit being delivered.,I am highly sorry as we have got it,Normally the same is used over the years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Securing the iPhone 15 from Amazon, especially with the advantageous deal and discount, felt like an absolute bargain.","I recently purchased the iPhone 15 in Pink from Amazon, and I couldn’t be happier with my decision! From the moment I unboxed it, the sleek design and soft pastel pink color caught my attention—it looks even better in person than in pictures. Phone is lightweight aluminum and glass build, making the phone feel premium yet comfortable to hold. The pink shade is elegant and subtle, perfect for anyone who loves a touch of sophistication. The 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is bright, sharp, and offers vibrant colors. Whether watching videos or scrolling through social media, the experience is smooth and immersive. The 48MP main camera and 12MP ultra-wide lens take incredible photos, even in low light. The details, sharpness, and colors are truly impressive. Portrait mode works beautifully, capturing professional-looking shots effortlessly. The front camera is equally good for selfies and FaceTime. Charging with the USB-C port is much more convenient than before, and fast charging is a plus. The delivery was fast and secure, with the iPhone arriving in perfect condition. The packaging was intact, and setting up the phone was a breeze. If you're looking for a stylish, powerful, and reliable phone, the iPhone 15 in Pink is a fantastic choice.","Full satisfaction
Good performance with fine quality and smooth run having good battery life",i Phone Is Iphone,"Mobile is superb and decent battery need to charge 2r 3 times in a day, mobile is heating sometimes.cemara is excellent.","Just made the transition and here’s my POV on the first ~2 month of use

Pros
- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants
- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here
- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless
- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA
- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome
- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.
- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone
- Apples approach on Security!
- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawless

Cons
- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm
- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchases

Industry memes
- USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much
- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!
- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?
- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for texting

Tips of managing battery health
- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh
- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up
- I charge my phone only using a power bank not direct wired or wireless charging
- Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%
- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service
- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section
- I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc
- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending above

Vendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.

….. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience","Design
One of the most noticeable changes to the iPhone 15 is its new design. The phone now has rounded edges, which makes it feel more comfortable in the hand. It also has a new camera bump that is less pronounced than the one on the iPhone 14.

Display
The iPhone 15 has the same 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display as the iPhone 14. However, the new display is brighter and has better contrast. It also supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision.

Performance
The iPhone 15 is powered by the new A16 Bionic chip, which is the fastest mobile chip on the market. The A16 Bionic chip is up to 20% faster than the A15 Bionic chip in the iPhone 14.

Camera
The iPhone 15 has a new 48-megapixel main camera. The new camera sensor is larger than the one in the iPhone 14, and it has better low-light performance. The iPhone 15 also has a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a new 12-megapixel telephoto camera.

Battery life
The iPhone 15 has the same battery life as the iPhone 14. This means that you can expect to get around a day of use on a single charge. Overall The iPhone 15 is a solid upgrade over the iPhone 14.

Pros
New design with rounded edges
More powerful A16 Bionic chip found in 14 pro
New 48-megapixel main camera
Brighter display with upto 2000 nits brightness
USB C can be used for anything
Dynamic Island

Cons
No 120hz display

Performance : no doubt in performance , it's the best in the industry ,
Camera : undoubtably very good in camera dipartment but I hardly take photos 😁
iOS : verry smooth and many good things are missing . Call recording , call pick up haptic , smart dial and many more little but verry important feature ..
Many youtuber says there is no such use of dynamic island but listen to me it is verry usefull and looking cool too
Price : obviously it's not value for money but it's far better than 13 and 14 launch price which is same .

Value for money.,Best performance best smoothness best screen size,Nice phone,Good product,Good phone very smooth and camera quality superb🩵,Good and improved device with latest features sound quality is awesome,"It is very best ,I am happy 😊 Thanks amazon",Excellent,"The display is impressively bright, despite the 60 Hz, which I thought might be a drawback coming from a 120 Hz Android device. Surprisingly, it feels the same. The battery life is solid, providing around 1.5 days for mild phone users. As a developer, with light usage for content consumption and social media, I get around 8 hours of screen on time with 25-30% battery left. It charges quickly to 50% and then trickle charges to 100%, adapting to usage patterns for faster charging. Initially, there were some battery drain and heating issues, but they resolved as the phone learned my usage patterns.

Now, the camera is impressive, especially in low light conditions. Despite lacking a dedicated long exposure mode, the default night option, averaging around 3 seconds, captures details even in the dark. Compared to the iPhone 14 and S21FE, the camera quality is top-notch. The auto portrait detection is a standout feature. Believe me no one explain the real use of that auto portrait theoretically until you try it.

In terms of network, the dual 5G standby supports Vi and JIO 5G (eSim). Inside my house, I get around 500 Mbps, and outside easily surpass 1 Gbps. Call quality is excellent, with two introduced modes in the mic option available in the control center.

This is my personal opinion; I'll update if I find anything noteworthy.","What a great colour , what great features loving it!",As expected delivered the product safely and no fraud done like Flipkart. The product is working great with awesome video recording and smooth software experience,"The pink iphone 15 has very classic baby pink shade.

Some find this mobile huge.
This has inbuilt call recording.

Go for this mobile if you are thinking for elderly person.",Normal,Overall it is good.,Mst phone hai,"1. The claim that the camera quality is 50 megapixels is FAR from the truth. To test it, I compared it with Realme C12, a 7-year-old 13-megapixel phone. Except for the color grading of the pixel, nothing really has changed! There is NO benefit of any resolution here. It is pretty clear that the 50-megapixel reported camera value by the company doesn't correspond to the actual hardware.

2. The battery and charging are the BIGGEST downside of the phone! The claim that the battery has around 5000+ mAh doesn't seem to be true. It is FAR inferior to my Realme C12 which reports 6000+ mAh battery. Charging doesn't work when the phone is switched on with a portable hotspot, data and GPS are on! So once switched off, the charging works well corresponding to a fast charger up to 90% of the battery charge status, after which it slows down and gets severely struck at 95% charging status. The last 5% take more than 15-20 mins!

3. Sound Quality is pretty normal and ordinary compared to any other phone.

4. The phone actually weighs more and is not as portable as my old 7.5k Realme C12. The camera design is pretty lame and has no performance benefit over Realme C12 in comparison. The circular extension at the back actually makes it difficult to hold a bit. The cameras are far more ordinary with just better color grading.

5. It doesn't support Airtel 5G as Manufacturers admit.

6. The memory capacity RAM is 4G, which is 1G improvement over Realme C12. But for an ordinary user with 4-5 years of use, this shouldn't affect him much, unless gaming or other performance extensive use.",Good,Good product at Competitive Price.. Good specifications..

2nd ly it's reglfresh rate also slow.

Others things are still looks ok.",PHONE IS GOOD BUT SOFT WARE IS NOT WORKING PROPERELY FROM FIRST DAY,"✅Comes with default Xiomi dialer so call recording feature is a huge plus point. One may never know when it's needed.

✅Bigger screen size: This has its own advantage and disadvantage. Good to use for elders when font size is increased on a already bigger screen size phone. Safe hand to eye distance can be easily achieved.
❌Issue is that bigger size bigger battery makes it bulky (keep in mind back cover will also add overall weight slightly). One hand use is risky because handling might become difficult for few people.

✅Battery backup: Not sure how much Xiomi has worked on battery backup but so far it's looking decent hopefully it stays this way in future as well. (Only other Redmi phone I used was their debut model in India 'Redmi 1S' that was launched way back 10 years ago and it wasn't so good on battery backup)

✅Updates: Received first update (security patch) today as I write this review.

✅ Charging speed is definitely good.

❌Storage: custom UI phones lack in this. Unnecessary apps, tweaks and customisation eat up system space. I've literally kept this phone as received it 2 weeks ago. No data saved so far and already 23 GB system space is full. 128 internal space in budget segment phones should now be default given size of apps and never ending updates.

🤷🏽Can't comment on 5G since I don't have jio connection. 4G is working fine.
❌Separate budget for screen protector and back cover.

Bought this for my mum so good for basic usage. Received this phone on 4th December 2024 so I believe 2 weeks period is still not enough to give final review.","Average average phone

Great product.,"I recently tried the Ambrane Mobile Stand, and I find it to be very useful! The adjustable design allows me to customize the viewing angle to my preference, making it perfect for video calls, streaming, or reading. The versatility in adjustments is definitely a highlight for me.

However, there is one significant drawback: the stand struggles to maintain its position at certain angles. Specifically, it tends to fall when adjusted between 45° and 60°, which can be quite frustrating during use.

Overall, the Ambrane Mobile Stand is a solid choice for its flexibility and convenience, but I hope to see improvements in stability to make it truly reliable at all angles.","Good product, More locking security needed",Good product,Nice product,It's a good and useable product,Item good,More Quality than expected.,Worth your money .,Consider Buying.,Very nice product and smooth usages,liked the product,Good product,Worth for money.,"Product is good, there is no extra option to tight, should place in the proper angle to make it stand otherwise it would come down

I still won't return this product because it gets the job done, and I haven't found a better alternative. I chose this one due to its good customer ratings. It's very versatile, and the grip is excellent. However, I would have liked more height for the stand.

Its elegant design, breathtaking display, and remarkably swift performance establish it as a premier device within the smartphone arena. The camera's exceptional quality allows for the capture of every moment with astonishing detail and clarity. Furthermore, the battery life is notably robust, effortlessly sustaining me through an entire day's use. Securing the iPhone 15 from Amazon, especially with the advantageous deal and discount, felt like an absolute bargain.","I recently purchased the iPhone 15 in Pink from Amazon, and I couldn’t be happier with my decision! From the moment I unboxed it, the sleek design and soft pastel pink color caught my attention—it looks even better in person than in pictures. Phone is lightweight aluminum and glass build, making the phone feel premium yet comfortable to hold. The pink shade is elegant and subtle, perfect for anyone who loves a touch of sophistication. The 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is bright, sharp, and offers vibrant colors. Whether watching videos or scrolling through social media, the experience is smooth and immersive. The 48MP main camera and 12MP ultra-wide lens take incredible photos, even in low light. The details, sharpness, and colors are truly impressive. Portrait mode works beautifully, capturing professional-looking shots effortlessly. The front camera is equally good for selfies and FaceTime. Charging with the USB-C port is much more convenient than before, and fast charging is a plus. The delivery was fast and secure, with the iPhone arriving in perfect condition. The packaging was intact, and setting up the phone was a breeze. If you're looking for a stylish, powerful, and reliable phone, the iPhone 15 in Pink is a fantastic choice.","Full satisfaction
Good performance with fine quality and smooth run having good battery life",i Phone Is Iphone,"Mobile is superb and decent battery need to charge 2r 3 times in a day, mobile is heating sometimes.cemara is excellent.","Just made the transition and here’s my POV on the first ~2 month of use

Pros
- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants
- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here
- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless
- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA
- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome
- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.
- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone
- Apples approach on Security!
- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawless

Cons
- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm
- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchases

Industry memes
- USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much
- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!
- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?
- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for texting

Tips of managing battery health
- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh
- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up
- I charge my phone only using a power bank not direct wired or wireless charging
- Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%
- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service
- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section
- I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc
- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending above

Vendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.

….. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience","Design

Camera
The iPhone 15 has a new 48-megapixel main camera. The new camera sensor is larger than the one in the iPhone 14, and it has better low-light performance. The iPhone 15 also has a new 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a new 12-megapixel telephoto camera.

Battery life
The iPhone 15 has the same battery life as the iPhone 14. This means that you can expect to get around a day of use on a single charge. Overall The iPhone 15 is a solid upgrade over the iPhone 14.

Pros
New design with rounded edges
More powerful A16 Bionic chip found in 14 pro
New 48-megapixel main camera
Brighter display with upto 2000 nits brightness

Quality best",Phone and display quality best,nice,"Everyone know about pros , let's only talk about cons
Battery : worst than I expect . Many says it is iOS 17 behind poor battery life . Hardly 3-4 he if you travelling and your network changes frequently .. worst than my android devices .
Performance : no doubt in performance , it's the best in the industry ,
Camera : undoubtably very good in camera dipartment but I hardly take photos 😁
iOS : verry smooth and many good things are missing . Call recording , call pick up haptic , smart dial and many more little but verry important feature ..
Many youtuber says there is no such use of dynamic island but listen to me it is verry usefull and looking cool too
Price : obviously it's not value for money but it's far better than 13 and 14 launch price which is same . Although this time iPhone 15 far better than 15 pro",Sexy phone.,"It’s believed iPhone 15 is way everyone is looking, people buy for enjoyment, but standard is something we wants, iPhones with standard person can win this","Charges slow, battery life is less than ok, camera is fine but nothing great compared to phones in the price range.

Value for money.,Best performance best smoothness best screen size,Nice phone,Good product,Good phone very smooth and camera quality superb🩵,Good and improved device with latest features sound quality is awesome,"It is very best ,I am happy 😊 Thanks amazon",Excellent,"The display is impressively bright, despite the 60 Hz, which I thought might be a drawback coming from a 120 Hz Android device. Surprisingly, it feels the same. The battery life is solid, providing around 1.5 days for mild phone users. As a developer, with light usage for content consumption and social media, I get around 8 hours of screen on time with 25-30% battery left. It charges quickly to 50% and then trickle charges to 100%, adapting to usage patterns for faster charging. Initially, there were some battery drain and heating issues, but they resolved as the phone learned my usage patterns.

Now, the camera is impressive, especially in low light conditions. Despite lacking a dedicated long exposure mode, the default night option, averaging around 3 seconds, captures details even in the dark. Compared to the iPhone 14 and S21FE, the camera quality is top-notch. The auto portrait detection is a standout feature. Believe me no one explain the real use of that auto portrait theoretically until you try it.

In terms of network, the dual 5G standby supports Vi and JIO 5G (eSim). Inside my house, I get around 500 Mbps, and outside easily surpass 1 Gbps. Call quality is excellent, with two introduced modes in the mic option available in the control center.

This is my personal opinion; I'll update if I find anything noteworthy.","What a great colour , what great features loving it!",As expected delivered the product safely and no fraud done like Flipkart. The product is working great with awesome video recording and smooth software experience,"The pink iphone 15 has very classic baby pink shade. The phone received is in perfect condition and is working well.
Love the phone",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
B0DH8BZ7V9,4.3,"I recently purchased the Portronics Type A to Type C adapter and I'm thoroughly impressed with its performance. I've been using this adapter to connect my USB drives, hard disks, and other peripherals to my Type C devices.

What I appreciate most about this adapter is its versatility. It supports multiple protocols, including USB 3.0, USB 2.0, and USB 1.1, making it compatible with a wide range of devices.

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the Portronics.

*Pros:*
- Compact and lightweight design
- Solid build quality
- Fast and reliable data transfer speeds

For just ₹109 its very cheap.","This affordable USB adapter is a fantastic choice for MacBook Pro enthusiasts who need to connect a mouse, external drive, or other USB 2.0 devices. I’ve used it occasionally, and it functions flawlessly without any compatibility issues.

Pros:
✅ Budget-Friendly – A great option for those looking for a cost-effective adapter.
✅ Reliable Performance – Works smoothly with no connection issues.

Cons:
❌ Slightly Long Design – A more compact, nano-style version would have been ideal for better portability.

Final Verdict:
If you need a dependable and budget-friendly USB adapter for your MacBook Pro, this is a solid choice. While a more compact design would improve portability, it still offers excellent value at this price.","Works faster.
